## Review

‚≠ê 4/5 - Worth a read

I think the title is a bit misleading here, the tet gives a nice and short overview on how to tackle a software architectural problem. It is not really a direct guide on how to become a software architect. I think there is more to it than this guide suggests. Anyhow it is a worth a reda for anyone who likes to get into this topic of becoming a software architect.

## Structure

In the *notes* folder you can find my notes from Remnote as Remnote file, markdown or html export. I did not add Remnote flashcards here, as I think this is not really useful in this case.
