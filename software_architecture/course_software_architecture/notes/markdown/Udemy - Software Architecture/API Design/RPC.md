- See [What is RPC?]()
- RPC is also referred to as  {{location transparency}} since for the developer of the client application, a method executed {{locally}} or {{remotely}} looks the same. 
- RPC frameworks written in {{different programming languages}} can talk to each other using RPC.
- 
- Explain how RPC is implemented >>>
    - Defining interface using the interface description language (IDL) of the used framework
    - Client and Server stub creation using the RPC Code Generation Tool
    - The custom object types from the API are compiled into classes or structs

- Explain the steps when an RPC call is made >>>
    - Serialization of requests
    - Transport to server
    - Deserialization in server
    - Executing the function
    - Same way back for the response from the server

- Benefits of RPC >>>
    - Simplified communication, calling like local methods
    - Language-agnostic, supports multiple platforms
    - The communication is abstracted away in a framework
    - Failure in the communication results in an error or exception
- Drawbacks of RPC >>>
    - Slower execution (can be addressed by asynchronous calls)
    - Increased complexity in error handling
        - For example, lost message, here idempotent operations can help
- 
- RPC is a good choice if: >>>
    - API provided to a different company instead of an end user or web page
    - Communication between different components within a large system
    - Abstracting away the network communication and focusing only on the actions the client wants to perform
- RPC is not a good fit >>>
    - Where we don't want to abstract the network communication and want to take direct advantage of HTTP cookies or headers.
    - When performance is critical and low latency is required.
    - Designing a data-centric API
    - All operations needed are simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- 
- RPC evolves more around {{actions}} and less around {{data/resources}}.

- Popular RPC Frameworks and Technologies
    - gRPC, developed by Google in 2015
    - Apache Thrift
    - Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
