- Define REST >>>
    - Representational State Transfer
    - Set of architectural constrains and best practices for defining APIs for the web
    - It is not a standard or a protocol
- 
- REST API style
    - Has a {{resource-oriented}} approach.
    - The main abstraction to the user is a {{named resource}} 
    - The {{resources}} encapsulate different entities in our system
    - REST API allows the user to manipulate {{resources}} through some methods
- 
- Explain HATEOAS >>>
    - Hypermedia as the Engine of the Application State
    - State representation to the client is done with hypermedia links

- Name REST API Quality Attributes >>>
    - Stateless Server
    - Server needs to define each response as cacheble or non-cacheable
- 
- Resources
    - Each resource is {{named}} and {{addressed}} using a {{URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)}}.
    - Each resource is either a {{simple}} or a {{collection}} resource. 
    - The resources are structured {{hierarchically}}, using {{"/"}} to denote levels.
    - Explain the difference between a simple and a collections resource→A simple resource represents a single entity with a state which can contain one or more sub-resources, while a collection resource represents a group of entities of the same type.
- 
- Best practices for naming resources >>>
    - Naming using nouns, verbs are for actions
    - Use plural nouns for collections
    - Give clear and meaningful names, avoid namings like elements or objects
    - Use consistent naming conventions across the API
    - The resource identifiers should be unique and URL friendly
- 
- The REST API limits the number of methods we can perform on each resource. These are >>>
    - Create a new resource ⇒ POST (can be made cacheable)
    - Updating an existing resource ⇒ PUT (idempotent)
    - Deleting an existing resource ⇒ DELETE (idempotent)
    - Getting the current state of the resource ⇒ GET (doesn't change state, idempotent, considered cacheable by default)
