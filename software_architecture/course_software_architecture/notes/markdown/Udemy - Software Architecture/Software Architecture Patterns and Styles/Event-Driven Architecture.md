- Instead of direct messages that issues command or requests that ask for data in an event-driven architecture, we have only {{events}}.
- 
- What is an event?→An event is an immutable statement of a fact or a change.
- 
- Which components do we have? >>>
    - Event producers
    - Event consumers
    - Message brokers
- 
- What benefits do we get? >>>
    - Decoupled components
    - Asynchronous messages
    - Scalability and flexibility (more services can be added without any changes)
    - Real-time stream analysis (Data analysis, Pattern detection, act upon data in real-time)
- 
- Describe the event sourcing pattern→Event sourcing is an architectural pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of events, enabling reconstruction of past states and facilitating auditing and replayability.
- 
- CQRS pattern
    - Stands for→Command Query Responsibility Segregation.
    - Which problems does it solve? >>>
        - Optimizing a database with high load of Read and Update operations (concurrent operations)
            - One database optimized for write, one for read
            - Events from Database A to B to update the data
        - Joining multiple tables located in separate databases that belong to different microservices
            - Changes in two databases of service A and B were sent as event which is taken from service C.
            - Joins the data and provides a read-only "materialized view".
