- Software architecture
    - There are multiple definitions for software architecture, here is the one used in this course
        - Definition→The software architecture of a system is a high-level description of the system's structure, its different components, and how those components communicate with each other to fulfill the systems' requirements and constraints.
    - What is not part of the software architecture?→Technologies, programming languages or in general implementation details.
    - When should you decide about implementation details?→After the high-level architecture is designed and approved. They should be delayed to the very end of the design.
- 
- Software architecture can have different levels of abstraction:
    - Classes/Structs
    - Modules/packages/libraries
    - Services (process or groups of processes)
- 
- Name the four stages of the software development cycle >>>
    - Design (output software architecture)
    - Implementation (input software architecture)
    - Testing
    - Deployment
- 
- Correctness of the software architecture cannot be proved!
