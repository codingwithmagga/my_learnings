- Name two strategies/patterns to process big data >>>
    - Batch processing
    - Real-Time processing
- 
- Batch processing model
    - Describe→A batch processing model processes large amounts of data in batches at scheduled intervals. The data is often stored in a DFS.
    - Advantages >>>
        - Easy to implement
        - High availability
        - Efficient
        - Higher fault tolerance
        - Complex and in-depth analysis of large datasets
    - Drawback→High latency due to delayed processing.
- 
- Real-Time processing
    - Describe→Real-time processing is the immediate analysis of data as it is generated.
    - Advantages→Real-time processing provides immediate insights and enables faster decision-making.
    - Drawbacks >>>
        - Hard to do complex analysis.
        - Doing data-fusion/analyzing historical data is impossible.
