- Relational Databases & ACID Transactions
    - Relational Database
        - Describe >>>
            - Data is stored in tables
            - Each row is a single record
            - The records are all related to each other through a set of predefined columns.
            - Each of the columns has a name and type and optional a set of constraints. 
            - Each record is uniquely identified by a key, represented by one or multiple columns.
        - The structure ({{schema}}) of each table is defined {{ahead of time}}.
        - How is data duplication avoided?→Data duplication is avoided by the opportunity to have a relation between different tables. For example, a product table with a product ID and a sales table where the product is referenced through the product ID.
        - Advantages? >>>
            - Support for complex queries
            - Efficient storage
            - Natural structure of data for humans
            - ACID transactions guarantee
        - Disadvantages >>>
            - Rigid structure, which needs to be defined before the database can be used. Changes require maintenance time.
            - Hard to maintain/scale
            - Slower read operations compared to non-relational operations
        - When to choose a relational database? >>>
            - Structured data requirements
            - Complex queries and transactions required
            - Read performance is not the most important quality attribute
    - 
    - SQL
        - Describe→SQL is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating data held in a relational database management system.
        - Different relational database implementations have their own additional features, but the majority of standard operations are the same for all relational databases.
    - 
    - ACID transactions
        - Explain the acronym >>>
            - Atomicity
            - Consistency
            - Isolation
            - Durability
        - Definition transaction→A transaction is a sequence of database operations that for an external observer should appear as a single operation.
        - Explain Atomicity→Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all operations of the transaction are done at once or are not done.
        - Explain Consistency→Consistency ensures that a transaction leaves the database in a valid state, e.g. no constraints are violated by a transaction. A committed transaction will be seen by all future queries/transactions.
        - Explain Isolation→Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions appear to execute sequentially, preventing interference between them.
        - Explain Durability→Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains persistent even in the event of system failures.
- Non-Relational Databases
    - What is the main difference between relational and non-relational databases?→Relational databases use structured tables with predefined schemas, while non-relational databases use flexible schemas and various data models.
    - Relational databases are designed for {{efficient storage}} and non-relational databases are designed for {{faster queries}}. 
    - What are the trade-offs of using a flexible schema in non-relational databases? >>>
        - Loose the ability to easily analyze the records, also multiple groups (join operations) becomes hard
        - ACID transaction are rarely supported
    - 
    - What are the three main types of non-relational databases? >>>
        - Document store
        - Key-value stores
        - Graph database
    - Explain the concept of a key value store database→A key-value store database stores data as key-value pairs, offering fast read and write operations. The type of value can be simple or complex. It can be seen as a large-scale hash table or dictionary.
    - Explain the concept of a document store database→A document store database stores data in flexible, self-contained documents. Each document is an object with different attributes of different types. These documents can be easily mapped to objects in a programming language.
    - Explain the concept of graph databases→A graph database is an extension of a document store and stores data as nodes and edges, representing relationships between data points.
    - Name use cases for a graph database >>>
        - Fraud detection: The same person uses multiple logical users to initiate multiple transactions
        - Recommendation engines: Recommendation of new products based on purchase history or friends of the user.
    - 
    - When to choose a non-relational database? >>>
        - Caching Task
        - Handling real-time big data
        - Unstructured data, different records can contain different attributes

- Techniques to Improve Performance, Availability & Scalability of Databases
    - Name three techniques to improve the mentioned quality attributes >>>
        - Database Indexing
        - Database Replication
        - Database Partitioning/Sharding
    - 
    - Database Indexing
        - Definition Database Index→A data structure (hash map, B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. Created from a particular column (single index) or group of columns (composite index). 
        - Define Composite Index→A composite index is an index that combines multiple columns to speed up queries involving those columns.
        - Tradeoffs for indexing >>>
            - Additional space for storing the index tables
            - Speed decrease for write operations
    - 
    - Database replication
        - Why should you replicate databases?→To eliminate the database as a single point of failure, improving performance, availability and scalability.
        - Tradeoff >>>
            - Higher complexity for operations like write, update and delete. Keeping multiple databases in a large-scale system consistent is not a trivial task.
            - Increased resource consumption.
    - 
    - Database Partitioning/Sharding
        - Describe this technique→Database partitioning divides a large database into smaller, more manageable parts.
        - Advantages >>>
            - Scaling, more data can be stored
            - Different queries that touch different parts of data can be performed in parallel
        - Drawback >>>
            - Increased complexity, especially for relational databases
            - Overhead for managing different parts, for example, keep them in a similar size
    - 
    - Indexing, Replication and Partitioning are completely {{orthogonal}} to each other. 
    - All three of them are commonly used together in most real-life large-scale systems.
- Brewer's (CAP) Theorem
    - Repeat the CAP Theorem→A distributed database can only provide two out of three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

    - What is a network partition→A network partition is a network failure that divides a network into multiple isolated segments.
    - What is partition tolerance?→Partition tolerance is the ability of a distributed system to continue operating despite network partitions.
    - What is consistency in the CAP theorem?→Consistency means every read receives the most recent write or an error.
    - What is availability in the CAP theorem?→Availability means that every request receives a non-error response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
    - Without a network partition, consistency and availability can both be fulfilled. Explain why we have to choose one when there is a network partition >>>
        - A network partition prevents communication between nodes, making it impossible to guarantee both consistency (all nodes have the same data) and availability (all nodes respond to requests) simultaneously. 
        - Choosing consistency: Service returns an error during network partition.
        - Choosing availability: Data is not consistent through the whole network.
        - Not that in reality a tradeoff can be made between consistency and availability, we don't have to choose one entirely.
    - When a database shall be distributed, we have to choose {{Partition tolerance}} out of three quality attributes in the CAP theorem.
    - 
- Scalable Unstructured Data Storage
    - What is unstructured data?→Data which doesn't follow a particular structure, schema or model. For example, "Blob" - Binary Large Object Files, like Audio, Video or Images. Often the data sets and each file or object itself of unstructured data are large.
    - Relational/non-relational databases are {{not optimized}}  for unstructured data. They often have also a size limit for binary objects (~megabytes).
    - 
    - Distributed File System (DFS)
        - Describe→A distributed file system (DFS) is a storage architecture that distributes data across multiple storage nodes. It is similar to a file system on a single computer.
        - Benefits >>>
            - No need for a special API.
            - Files can be modified easily.
            - Efficient for high-performance operations
        - Limitations >>>
            - Number of files is limited
            - No easy access through web API (HTTP+ REST)
    - 
    - Object Store
        - Describe→An object store is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than files or blocks. Each object contains the data itself, along with metadata and a unique identifier, allowing for easy retrieval and management.
        - Benefits >>>
            - Linear scalability
            - No limit to the number of objects
            - Very high limit on single object size (~5-10 Terabytes)
            - Provides an HTTP + REST API
            - Supports versioning out of the box
            - 
        - Drawbacks >>>
            - Objects are immutable, objects needs to be replaced if changed
            - No easy access like a file-system, access through an SDK or REST API
            - Lower IO performance compared to DFS
