- Requirements & API
    - Important Observation: 2 major actors, merchants and users/buyers.
    - Example questions
        - Merchants
            - What type of products are we selling? Physical or digital?
            - What product information does a merchant provide?
            - What data do we need to provide the merchant?
            - What operation can a merchant perform?
        - Users
            - Can anyone browse/purchase, or is registration required?
            - Are Product Reviews/Ratings in scope?
            - Search capabilities?
            - Do we need to design checkout/payment/delivery?
            - What UI do we offer? Browser/Mobile?
    - Assume the following functional requirements
        - Product
            - Physical product (with limited inventory)

                - Browser products
                - Search products based on title/categories/description
                - Out of scope: User registration, product reviews
            - Store Checkout
                - Navigate to the checkout page
                - View breakdown of the bill incl. taxes
                - Complete the purchase by providing shipping + payment info

    - Assume the following nonfunctional requirements
        - Merchants
            - Scalability (not very high)
                - Hundreds of merchants
                - Low traffic
                - Thousands of products
            - Performance
                - Response time < 1 second at 50th percentile
            - Consistency vs. Availability
                - CP databases
            - High availability
                - Uptime 99.5%
        - User
            - Scalability (very high)
                - 10â€“100 million daily users
                - Multiple countries
                - High traffic at peak
            - Performance
                - Products reponse time < 200ms 50p, 500mms 99p
                - Checkout response time <1s 99p
            - Consistency vs. Availability
                - Storefront: AP
                - Checkout: CP
            - High availability
                - Internal SLA: 99.99% uptime
    - We ignore system constraints for now.
    - Defining of the system API would be very technical. Base are the sequence diagrams above from the functional requirements.

- Functional Diagram
    - Go through the functional requirements step by step and add them to the architectural diagram. Ignore the non-functional requirements for now.
