- System constraints
    - Why are system constraints often referred to as pillars for software architecture? >>>
        - They provide a solid starting point
        - The rest of the system need to be designed around them
    - Name different types >>>
        - Technical constraints
        - Business constraints
        - Regulatory/legal constraints
    - Examples for technical constraints? >>>
        - Being locked to a particular hardware/cloud vendor
        - Having to use a particular programming language
        - Having to use a particular database or technology
        - Having to support certain platforms, browsers, or OS
    - Examples for business constraints >>>
        - Limited budget
        - Strict deadline
    - Example for regulatory/legal constraintsâ†’Data protection in different countries
    - What should be considered at these constraints? >>>
        - Any given constraint shouldn't be taken lightly
        - Use loosely coupled architecture
