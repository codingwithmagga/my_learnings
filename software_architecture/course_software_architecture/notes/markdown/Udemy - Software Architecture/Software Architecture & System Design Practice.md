- Design a Highly Scalable Design Forum
    - System Design Step-By-Step Process >>>
        - Ask questions to capture: functional and non-functional requirements, system constraints
        - Define the systems API
        - Create a Software Architecture Diagram to fulfill the Functional Requirements
        - Refine the Software Architecture Diagram to address the Non-Functional Requirements
    - 
    - The most important thing in system design: Make the {{right trade-offs}} based on the given requirements. 
    - 
    - Requirements & API
        - Example questions:
            - Can anyone post or view post/comments?
            - What can a post contain? (text/images/video)
            - What is the meaning of "most popular posts"?
            - What is the structure of the comments? (flat list vs tree)
        - Assume the following functional requirements
            - A user can sign up and login to post, vote or comment.
            - A user should be able to create a new post that contains a
                - title
                - Topic tags
                - Body (text or uploaded images)
            - A user should be able to comment on any existing post.
            - Comments are ordered chronologically as a flat list.
            - User can delete their own post or comments.
            - A logged-in user can upvote/downvote an existing post/comment.
            - Present the top most popular posts in the last 24 hours on the homepage, where popularity = Upvotes-Downvotes.
        - Assume the following nonfunctional requirements
            - Scalability (millions of daily users)
            - Performance (less than 500ms response time 99p)
            - Fault Tolerance / High Availability (99.9%)
            - Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP over CP)
            - Durability
        - We ignore system constraints for now.
        - Using REST API over HTTP since this is a client web-based application
            - Identifying entities: Users, Posts, Images, Comments, Votes
            - Mapping Entities to URIs:

        - Using API Pagination, s.t. the user does not get millions of posts/comments at once
