- Load Balancer
    - What is the purpose of a load balancer?→Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure high availability. Additionally, it serves as a single server abstraction, meaning our service looks like it's running on one single server.
    - Which quality attributes are provided? >>>
        - Scalability
        - High Availability
        - Performance (Throughput), additionally latency added by the load balancer is inferior to the ability to handle more requests on multiple servers
        - Maintainability
    - Name different types of load balancers >>>
        - DNS load balancing
        - Hardware load balancing
        - Software load balancing
        - Global Server Load Balancing
    - Explain DNS→Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the internet infrastructure that maps human-friendly URLs to IP Addresses. It is the "phone book of the internet".
    - DNS load balancing
        - Explain→The DNS server sends a list of IP addresses of our servers back to the client. It will rotate them at each request, which balances the load automatically, since most clients just take the first address in the list.
        - Advantages >>>
            - Simple
            - Cheap (comes for free by purchasing a domain name)
        - Disadvantage >>>
            - The DNS server doesn't check the health of the servers. It can take some time to update the list of IP addresses in the DNS server, since it will be changed based on the configured TTL. Also, it may be cached in different computers.
            - The strategy is a simple round-robin, different server powers or that a server may be overloaded is not considered.
            - All IP addresses are public ⇒ security issue.
    - Hard- and Software load balancers
        - Explain the difference→Hardware load balancers are dedicated physical devices designed and optimized for load balancing, while software load balancers are software applications that can run on any computer to perform load balancing functions.
        - Advantages >>>
            - Better security, since the IP addresses and number of servers are not exposed.
            - Actively monitoring possible
            - Intelligent load balancing possible
            - It can also be used internally for different services

        - Disadvantage→Additional latency, which can be minimized when the load balancers servers are located physically close to the server running the services. Multiple load balancers may be required when there exists multiple data centers in different locations.
    - Global Server Load Balancing (GLSB)
        - Describe→A hybrid between a DNS service and a hardware/software load balancer for global traffic distribution. Solving the latency issue from the latter ones. It can be configured on various strategies for route traffic.

- Cloud Based Load Balancing Solutions
    - AWS - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
        - Amazon ELB is a highly scalable load balancing solution. It is an ideal solution for running on AWS, and integrates seamlessly with all of AWS services. It can operate in 4 different modes:
            - Application (Layer 7) Load Balancer - Ideal for advanced load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic
            - Network (Layer 4) Load Balancer - Ideal for load balancing of both TCP and UDP traffic
            - Gateway Load Balancer - Ideal for deploying, scaling, and managing your third-party virtual appliances.
            - Classic Load Balancer (Layer 4 and 7) - Ideal for routing traffic to EC2 instances.
        - For the full documentation on Amazon ELB and its autoscaling policies follow this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html) 
    - GCP - Cloud Load Balancing
        - Google Cloud Platform Load Balancer is Google's highly scalable and robust load-balancing solution. "Cloud Load Balancing allows you to put your resources behind a single IP address that is externally accessible or internal to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network". Some of the load balancer types available as part of the GCP Cloud Load Balancing are:
            - External HTTP(S) Load Balancer - Externally facing HTTP(s) (Layer 7) load balancer which enables you to run and scale your services behind an internal IP address
            - Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer - Internal Layer 7 load balancer that enables you to run and scale your services behind an internal IP address.
            - External TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer - Externally facing TCP/UDP (Layer 4) load balancer
            - Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancer - Internally facing TCP/UDP (Layer 4) load balancer.
