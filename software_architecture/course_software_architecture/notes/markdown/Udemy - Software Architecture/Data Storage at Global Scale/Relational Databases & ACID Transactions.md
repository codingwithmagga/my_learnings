- Relational Database
    - Describe >>>
        - Data is stored in tables
        - Each row is a single record
        - The records are all related to each other through a set of predefined columns.
        - Each of the columns has a name and type and optional a set of constraints. 
        - Each record is uniquely identified by a key, represented by one or multiple columns.
    - The structure ({{schema}}) of each table is defined {{ahead of time}}.
    - How is data duplication avoided?→Data duplication is avoided by the opportunity to have a relation between different tables. For example, a product table with a product ID and a sales table where the product is referenced through the product ID.
    - Advantages? >>>
        - Support for complex queries
        - Efficient storage
        - Natural structure of data for humans
        - ACID transactions guarantee
    - Disadvantages >>>
        - Rigid structure, which needs to be defined before the database can be used. Changes require maintenance time.
        - Hard to maintain/scale
        - Slower read operations compared to non-relational operations
    - When to choose a relational database? >>>
        - Structured data requirements
        - Complex queries and transactions required
        - Read performance is not the most important quality attribute
- 
- SQL
    - Describe→SQL is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating data held in a relational database management system.
    - Different relational database implementations have their own additional features, but the majority of standard operations are the same for all relational databases.
- 
- ACID transactions
    - Explain the acronym >>>
        - Atomicity
        - Consistency
        - Isolation
        - Durability
    - Definition transaction→A transaction is a sequence of database operations that for an external observer should appear as a single operation.
    - Explain Atomicity→Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all operations of the transaction are done at once or are not done.
    - Explain Consistency→Consistency ensures that a transaction leaves the database in a valid state, e.g. no constraints are violated by a transaction. A committed transaction will be seen by all future queries/transactions.
    - Explain Isolation→Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions appear to execute sequentially, preventing interference between them.
    - Explain Durability→Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains persistent even in the event of system failures.
