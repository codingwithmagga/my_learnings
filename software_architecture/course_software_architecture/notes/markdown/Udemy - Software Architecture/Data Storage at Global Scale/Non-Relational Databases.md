- What is the main difference between relational and non-relational databases?→Relational databases use structured tables with predefined schemas, while non-relational databases use flexible schemas and various data models.
- Relational databases are designed for {{efficient storage}} and non-relational databases are designed for {{faster queries}}. 
- What are the trade-offs of using a flexible schema in non-relational databases? >>>
    - Loose the ability to easily analyze the records, also multiple groups (join operations) becomes hard
    - ACID transaction are rarely supported
- 
- What are the three main types of non-relational databases? >>>
    - Document store
    - Key-value stores
    - Graph database
- Explain the concept of a key value store database→A key-value store database stores data as key-value pairs, offering fast read and write operations. The type of value can be simple or complex. It can be seen as a large-scale hash table or dictionary.
- Explain the concept of a document store database→A document store database stores data in flexible, self-contained documents. Each document is an object with different attributes of different types. These documents can be easily mapped to objects in a programming language.
- Explain the concept of graph databases→A graph database is an extension of a document store and stores data as nodes and edges, representing relationships between data points.
- Name use cases for a graph database >>>
    - Fraud detection: The same person uses multiple logical users to initiate multiple transactions
    - Recommendation engines: Recommendation of new products based on purchase history or friends of the user.
- 
- When to choose a non-relational database? >>>
    - Caching Task
    - Handling real-time big data
    - Unstructured data, different records can contain different attributes
