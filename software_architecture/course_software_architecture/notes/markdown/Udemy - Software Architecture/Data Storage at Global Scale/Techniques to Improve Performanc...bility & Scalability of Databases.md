- Name three techniques to improve the mentioned quality attributes >>>
    - Database Indexing
    - Database Replication
    - Database Partitioning/Sharding
- 
- Database Indexing
    - Definition Database Index→A data structure (hash map, B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. Created from a particular column (single index) or group of columns (composite index). 
    - Define Composite Index→A composite index is an index that combines multiple columns to speed up queries involving those columns.
    - Tradeoffs for indexing >>>
        - Additional space for storing the index tables
        - Speed decrease for write operations
- 
- Database replication
    - Why should you replicate databases?→To eliminate the database as a single point of failure, improving performance, availability and scalability.
    - Tradeoff >>>
        - Higher complexity for operations like write, update and delete. Keeping multiple databases in a large-scale system consistent is not a trivial task.
        - Increased resource consumption.
- 
- Database Partitioning/Sharding
    - Describe this technique→Database partitioning divides a large database into smaller, more manageable parts.
    - Advantages >>>
        - Scaling, more data can be stored
        - Different queries that touch different parts of data can be performed in parallel
    - Drawback >>>
        - Increased complexity, especially for relational databases
        - Overhead for managing different parts, for example, keep them in a similar size
- 
- Indexing, Replication and Partitioning are completely {{orthogonal}} to each other. 
- All three of them are commonly used together in most real-life large-scale systems.
