- Name categories of possible failures >>>
    - Human Error
    - Software errors
    - Hardware failures
- 
- {{Fault Tolerance}} is the best way to achieve {{High Availability}}  in our system.
- 
- Define Fault Tolerance→Fault Tolerance enables our system to remain operational and available to the users despite failures within one or multiple components.
- 
- When failures happen, a fault-tolerant system will >>>
    - Continue operating at the same/reduced level of performance
    - Prevent the system from becoming unavailable
- 
- Fault Tolerance revolves around 3 major tactics >>>
    - Failure Prevention
    - Failure Detection and Isolation
    - Recovery from failure
- 
- Failure Prevention
    - To prevent our entire system from going down, {{eliminate any Single Point of Failure}} in our system. The best way to eliminate this is through {{Replication and Redundancy}} .
    - Examples for Single Point of Failure >>>
        - One server where the application runs
        - Storing all data in one instance of our database that runs on a single computer
- 
- Types of Redundancy
    - Name two→Spatial and Time Redundancy
    - Define Spatial Redundancy→Running replicas of our application on different computers
    - Define Time Redundancy→Repeating the same operation/request multiple times until we succeed/give up
- 
- Strategies for Redundancy and Replication
    - Name two strategies >>>
        - Active-Active architecture
        - Active-Passive architecture
    - Active-Active architecture
        - Describe→All replicas are synchronized with each other, such that a failure replica can be replaced by any other.
        - Advantages? >>>
            - Load is spread among all the replicas ⇒identical to horizontal scalability
            - Allows more traffic, better performance
        - Disadvantage? >>>
            - Additional coordination for synchronization
    - Active-Passive architecture
        - Describe→Active-passive architecture has one active replica handling all requests and (multiple) passive replica following the active one by taking periodic snapshots.
        - Advantage? >>>
            - Implementation is easier, since there is a clear leader
        - Disadvantage? >>>
            - Ability to scale the system is lost
- 
- Failure Detection and Isolation
    - How to detect failures?→Using a monitoring service which sends health checks or gets heartbeats to/from each instance/client. Detected failures are isolated and don't get requests any longer.
    - Why are false negatives in the monitoring service problematic?→False negatives mask actual failures, hindering timely responses and potentially leading to cascading system failures.
- 
- Recovery from failure
    - Possible actions after detecting a failure >>>
        - Stop sending traffic/workload to the host
        - Restart the host
        - Rollback, going back to a stable version
