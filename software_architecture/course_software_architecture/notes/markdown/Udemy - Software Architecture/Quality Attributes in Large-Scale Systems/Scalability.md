- Definition?→The measure of a system's ability to handle a growing amount of work, in an easy and cost-effective way, by adding resources to the system.
- Motivation→Load/Traffic changes over time, for example at global events, weather, day/night cycle etc.
- Name three types of scalability >>>
    - Vertical scalability (Scale Up)
    - Horizontal scalability (Scale Out)
    - Team/Organization scalability 
- The three types of scalability (vertical, horizontal, team) are {{orthogonal}} to each other, which means that each part can be {{increased/decreased separately}} 
- Vertical Scalability
    - Definition→Adding resources or upgrading the existing resources on a single computer, to allow our system to handle higher traffic or load.
    - Pros? >>>
        - Any application can benefit from it, no code changes are required
        - Migration between different machines is easy
    - Cons?
        - The scope of upgrade is limited
        - Locked to a centralized system, which cannot provide high availability and fault tolerance
- Horizontal Scalability
    - Definition→Adding more resources in a form of new instance running on different machines, to allow our system to handle higher traffic or load.
    - Pros? >>>
        - No limit on scalability
        - Easy to add/remove machines
        - If designed correctly, we get: High Availability and fault tolerance
    - Disadvantages? >>>
        - Initial code changes may be required
        - Increased complexity, coordination overhead
- Team/Organization scalability 
    - Hiring engineers can increase productivity up to some point, then we observe productivity degradation. 
        - What are the possible reasons for that? >>>
            - Many crowded meetings
            - Code merge conflicts
            - Business complexity - longer ramp up time
            - Testing is harder and slower
            - Releases become very risky
        - What are the options to solve this problem? >>>
            - Separate code in different modules of the same service
            - Separate product in multiple services
    - Software architecture impacts {{engineering velocity (team productivity)}}
