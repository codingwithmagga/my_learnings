- Availability is an important attribute since it has the greatest impact on {{our users}} and {{our business}} . Downtime can result in a loss of {{money }}  and {{customers}} .
- Definition→The fraction of time/probability that our service is operationally functional and accessible to the user.
- Uptime↔Time that our system is operationally functional and accessible to the user.
- Downtime::Time that our system is unavailable to the user.
- How is it measured?→Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime) or MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
- MTBF 
    - Define >>>
        - Mean Time between failures
        - Represents the average time our system is operational
    - When is it useful >>>
        - Dealing with multiple pieces of hardware
        - Each component has its own operational shelf life
        - Not using a cloud/third-party API with a given uptime and availability
- MTTR
    - Define >>>
        - Mean Time to Recovery
        - Time average it takes us to detect and recover from failure
        - Average downtime of our system
    - {{Detectability}}  and {{fast recovery}}  can help us achieve {{high availability}} 
- 
- When do we have high availability (at which value/percentile)? >>>
    - No strict definition, but the industry standard set by cloud vendors is typically 99.9% or higher
