- SLA
    - Describe >>>
        - Service-Level Agreement
        - A legal contract that represents the quality service of a system like:
            - Availability
            - Performance
            - Data durability
            - Time to respond to system failures
        - States Penalties and financial consequences if the contract is breached:
            - Full/Partial refunds
            - Subscription/License extensions
            - Service credits
    - For whom do they exist >>>
        - External paying users (always)
        - Free external users (sometimes), for example for free trial periods
        - Internal users (occasionally), for example if an internal service relies on us which has external users
    - SLAs are crafted by {{the business and the legal team}}.
- 
- SLO
    - Describe >>>
        - Service-Level Objectives
        - Individuals goals set for the system
        - Quantifiable targets for service performance
    - Example >>>
        - Availability SLO of 99.9%
        - Response time SLO of less than 100 milliseconds at 90th percentile
        - Issue Resolution SLO of 24–48 hours.
    - Relationship between SLA and SLO?→The SLA units all SLOs in a single document.
    - SLO represents the {{target values}} for the {{important quality attributes}}.
    - How should SLOs be determined? >>>
        - Take metrics which the users care about the most
        - Define SLOs around those metrics
        - Determine SLIs to track those SLOs
        - Don't measure every single possible SLI in a system and define an SLO for it! Fewer SLOs are better.
        - Be realistic, left room for errors. For example, 99.9% availability instead of 99.99%. The higher one can be used internally as commitment.

- SLI
    - Describe >>>
        - Service Level Indicators
        - Quantitative Measure of our compliance with a SLO
        - Actual numbers measured by a monitoring service or calculated from logs.
        - They can later be compared to the SLOs
    - Why is it important that quality attributes are testable and measurable?→If they weren't measurable, it would not be possible to find any SLI to validate the SLOs. If we can't prove the SLOs, we can't say that we meet the SLA.
    - SLOs and SLIs are defined and set by {{the software engineers and architects}}.
- 
- Create a recovery plan for when the SLIs show that we are not meeting our SLOs.
    - So we need to decide ahead of time what to do if: >>>
        - The system went down for a long time.
        - Performance degrades
        - Reports about issues/bugs in the system.
    - What should the plan include? >>>
        - Automatic alerts to engineer/DevOps
        - Automatic failovers/restarts/rollbacks/auto-scaling policies
        - Predefined handbooks on what to do in certain situations
