- DNS, Load Balancing & GLSB
    - Load Balancer
        - What is the purpose of a load balancer?→Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure high availability. Additionally, it serves as a single server abstraction, meaning our service looks like it's running on one single server.
        - Which quality attributes are provided? >>>
            - Scalability
            - High Availability
            - Performance (Throughput), additionally latency added by the load balancer is inferior to the ability to handle more requests on multiple servers
            - Maintainability
        - Name different types of load balancers >>>
            - DNS load balancing
            - Hardware load balancing
            - Software load balancing
            - Global Server Load Balancing
        - Explain DNS→Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the internet infrastructure that maps human-friendly URLs to IP Addresses. It is the "phone book of the internet".
        - DNS load balancing
            - Explain→The DNS server sends a list of IP addresses of our servers back to the client. It will rotate them at each request, which balances the load automatically, since most clients just take the first address in the list.
            - Advantages >>>
                - Simple
                - Cheap (comes for free by purchasing a domain name)
            - Disadvantage >>>
                - The DNS server doesn't check the health of the servers. It can take some time to update the list of IP addresses in the DNS server, since it will be changed based on the configured TTL. Also, it may be cached in different computers.
                - The strategy is a simple round-robin, different server powers or that a server may be overloaded is not considered.
                - All IP addresses are public ⇒ security issue.
        - Hard- and Software load balancers
            - Explain the difference→Hardware load balancers are dedicated physical devices designed and optimized for load balancing, while software load balancers are software applications that can run on any computer to perform load balancing functions.
            - Advantages >>>
                - Better security, since the IP addresses and number of servers are not exposed.
                - Actively monitoring possible
                - Intelligent load balancing possible
                - It can also be used internally for different services
                    - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Lt7PTVHpGtERsqmUIVNAifkkA4yuRmeNpeV3YBoMfJ4y7sxmm48DS1RnD1jAvWlUD4-hoKZVvj2nlQLMXz-NYRCTy_LtttZfBSvCUTNjoQYHhtTgLb7Dqj3t34DYqG8T.png)
            - Disadvantage→Additional latency, which can be minimized when the load balancers servers are located physically close to the server running the services. Multiple load balancers may be required when there exists multiple data centers in different locations.
        - Global Server Load Balancing (GLSB)
            - Describe→A hybrid between a DNS service and a hardware/software load balancer for global traffic distribution. Solving the latency issue from the latter ones. It can be configured on various strategies for route traffic.

        - No padding in the system to absorb a sudden increase in traffic or load
    - 
    - What is a message broker?→A software architectural building block inside our system that uses the queue data structure to store messages between senders and receivers. Decouples senders from the receivers and is fundamental for asynchronous software architecture.

- API Gateway
    - What problem does the API Gateway solve?→It manages and secures access to multiple backend services. With this, not every backend needs to implement its own security, authentication and authorization.
    - 
    - What does an API Gateway do? >>>
        - An API gateway manages and secures external access to multiple internal APIs, providing just one single API to external users.
        - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/qQH0WDU4RLGYBA5ldoJ2vn7zXh55nXe05pQcsFRv-QF_nXFaViKtklhyx-_kLPSqYLOpXDDsdlzcJPvUlkA3diDVimwdKPzGm0lRhxuLDGrRnLCJi2DAYULr442yAj97.png)
    - Name benefits of an API Gateway >>>

        - Caching static content and responses
        - Protocol translation
    - 
    - Considerations
        - API Gateway shouldn't contain any {{business logic.}}
        - API Gateway may become a {{single point of failure}}. 
        - Avoid {{bypassing}} API Gateway from external services.

- Content Delivery Network - CDN
    - What is a CDN?→A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that caches content to improve delivery speed and reduce latency.
    - CDNs provide service by {{caching}} our website content on their {{edge servers}}, which are relocated at different {{Points of Presence (PoP).}} {{Edge servers}} are {{physically closer}} to the user and {{strategy located}} in terms of network infrastructure.
    - CDNs can be used to deliver the following resources >>>
        - Images
        - Text
        - CSS
        - JavaScript files
        - Video streams (live and on-demand)
    - Quality attributes of CDNs >>>
        - Performance ⇒ faster page loads
        - High availability ⇒ issues/slowness are less noticeable
        - Security ⇒ Protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
    - How are CDNs improved? >>>
        - Use faster and more optimized HDDs
        - Reduce bandwidth by compressing the content
    - 
    - Name different strategies of CDNs >>>
        - Pull strategy
        - Push strategy
    - 
    - Pull strategy
        - How does it work?→The service tells the CDN which content is cached and how the cache needs to be invalidated by setting the Time To Live (TTL) property. When the TTL expires, the CDN downloades the content again from the server.
        - Advantage >>>
            - Lower maintenance, once set up, everything is done by the CDN.
        - Drawbacks >>>
            - First user of an asset which is not cached will have a longer latency
            - Increased load on the origin server during peak times when TTL is similar of all assets
            - Still a high availability necessary on our system.
    - Push strategy
        - How does it work?→The origin server pushes content updates to CDN edge servers.
        - Advantage? >>>
            - When content doesn't change frequently, one push to the CDN is enough. Reduces traffic and temporarily downtime of our system can be caught.
        - Drawback >>>
            - If the content changes frequently, we actively need to push it every time to the CDN.
