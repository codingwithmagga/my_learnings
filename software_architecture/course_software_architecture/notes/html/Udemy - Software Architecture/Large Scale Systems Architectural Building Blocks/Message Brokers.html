    <ul>
        <li>Drawbacks of synchronous communication
            <ul>
                <li>Both instances have to be healthy and maintain the connection</li>
                <li>No padding in the system to absorb a sudden increase in traffic or load</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>What is a message broker?â†’A software architectural building block inside our system that uses the queue data structure to store messages between senders and receivers. Decouples senders from the receivers and is fundamental for asynchronous software architecture.</li>
        <li>Capabilities of a message broker?
            <ul>
                <li>Buffering messages</li>
                <li>Message routing</li>
                <li>Transformation &amp; Validation</li>
                <li>Load balancing</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>How does a message broker increases fault tolerance, availability and scalability?
            <ul>
                <li>By decoupling components, allowing one component to be temporarily unavailable without affecting others. </li>
                <li>Prevent messages from being lost.</li>
                <li>Messages can be queued up during traffic spikes</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Name drawbacks when using a message broker
            <ul>
                <li>Increased complexity</li>
                <li>Potential single point of failure</li>
                <li>Added latency (mostly not significant)</li>
            </ul>
