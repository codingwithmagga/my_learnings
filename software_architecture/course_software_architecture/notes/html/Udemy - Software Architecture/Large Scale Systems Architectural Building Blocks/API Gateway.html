    <ul>
        <li>What problem does the API Gateway solve?→It manages and secures access to multiple backend services. With this, not every backend needs to implement its own security, authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>What does an API Gateway do?
            <ul>
                <li>An API gateway manages and secures external access to multiple internal APIs, providing just one single API to external users.</li>

        <li>Name benefits of an API Gateway
            <ul>
                <li>Seamless internal modifications/refactoring</li>
                <li>Consolidating all security, authorization and authentication in a single place</li>
                <li>Load balancing and traffic management, including health checks</li>
                <li>Request routing, saving the user from making multiple requests to different services</li>
                <li>Caching static content and responses</li>
                <li>Protocol translation</li>

                <li>API Gateway may become a {{3151577589661304::single point of failure}}. </li>
                <li>Avoid {{2523572424012993::bypassing}} API Gateway from external services. </li>
