        <li>Software architecture
            <ul>
                <li>There are multiple definitions for software architecture, here is the one used in this course
                    <ul>
                        <li>Definition→The software architecture of a system is a high-level description of the system&#39;s structure, its different components, and how those components communicate with each other to fulfill the systems&#39; requirements and constraints.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is not part of the software architecture?→Technologies, programming languages or in general implementation details.</li>
                <li>When should you decide about implementation details?→After the high-level architecture is designed and approved. They should be delayed to the very end of the design.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Software architecture can have different levels of abstraction:
            <ul>
                <li>Classes/Structs</li>
                <li>Modules/packages/libraries</li>
                <li>Services (process or groups of processes)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Name the four stages of the software development cycle
            <ul>
                <li>Design (output software architecture)</li>
                <li>Implementation (input software architecture)</li>
                <li>Testing</li>
                <li>Deployment</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Correctness of the software architecture cannot be proved!</li>
