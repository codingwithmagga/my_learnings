      Multi-Tier Architecture
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe what is a multi-tier architecture→A multi-tier architecture is a system which is separated into multiple logical (limiting the scope) and physical distinct tiers. The physical separation allows each tier to be separately developed, upgraded and scaled. </li>
        <li>What is the difference to a multi layer architecture?→Multi-tier architecture distributes application components across multiple physical tiers, while multi-layer architecture separates components into logical layers within a single tier.</li>
        <li>Name restrictions, which allow this architecture to be loosely coupled
            <ul>
                <li>Usage of client-server model</li>
                <li>It is not allowed to skip tiers, they must call each other in a specific order.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>The three-tier architecture is the most common and popular architectural pattern for client-server, web-based services.
            <ul>
                <li>Describe
                    <ul>
                        <li>A three-tier architecture separates an application into presentation, application, and data tiers for improved organization and scalability.</li>
                        <li>Presentation tier: Displays information, takes user input, no business logic</li>
                        <li>Application tier: Contains business logic and processes user requests, communicates with the data tier. Sometimes also called business or logic tier.</li>
                        <li>Data tier: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, ensuring data (user and business) integrity and security.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Advantages
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy to scale horizontally</li>
                        <li>Easy to maintain, the logic is concentrated in the application tier</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Drawback→Monolithic structure of the logic tier. Business concentrated in a single codebase. Possible high CPU and memory consumption and low development policy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Two tier architecture
            <ul>
                <li>Describe→One tier for presentation and business tier, for example desktop applications. One tier for data and storage, often remotely.</li>
                <li>Advantages
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eliminates overhead of the logic tier in the three tier architecture</li>
                        <li>Faster, more native experience for the user</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>There is also a four and five (not often used) tier architecture.</li>
