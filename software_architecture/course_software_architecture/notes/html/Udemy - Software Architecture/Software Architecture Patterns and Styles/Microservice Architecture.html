      Microservice Architecture
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe→Microservice architecture organizes our business logic as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployed services. Each service is owned by a small team and has a narrow scope of responsibility. </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Advantages
            <ul>
                <li>Small codebase ⇒ faster and easier development, test, and deployment</li>
                <li>Better performance and horizontal scalability</li>
                <li>Better organizational scalability</li>
                <li>Better security (fault isolation)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Drawbacks
            <ul>
                <li>All the advantages don&#39;t come out-of-the-box by switching from a monolithic (tier) architecture to a microservice architecture. </li>
                <li>Overhead </li>
                <li>Additional challenges (for example, each change should only happen in one service)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Name important best practices
            <ul>
                <li>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
                <li>Separate Database per service</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
