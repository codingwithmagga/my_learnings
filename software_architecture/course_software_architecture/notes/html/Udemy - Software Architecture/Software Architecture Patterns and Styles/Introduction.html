        <li>What are software architectural patterns?â†’These are general, repeatable solutions to commonly occurring system design problems. This involves, in general, multiple components that run as separate units.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Why use software architectural patterns?
            <ul>
                <li>Save valuable time and resources</li>
                <li>Avoid the risk to make our architecture resemble a Big Ball of Mud (anti-Pattern, no structure, tightly coupled system, ...)</li>
                <li>Other engineers/architects can follow the pattern</li>
            </ul>
