      Brewer&#39;s (CAP) Theorem
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Repeat the CAP Theorem→A distributed database can only provide two out of three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

        <li>What is a network partition→A network partition is a network failure that divides a network into multiple isolated segments.</li>
        <li>What is partition tolerance?→Partition tolerance is the ability of a distributed system to continue operating despite network partitions.</li>
        <li>What is consistency in the CAP theorem?→Consistency means every read receives the most recent write or an error.</li>
        <li>What is availability in the CAP theorem?→Availability means that every request receives a non-error response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.</li>
        <li>Without a network partition, consistency and availability can both be fulfilled. Explain why we have to choose one when there is a network partition
            <ul>
                <li>A network partition prevents communication between nodes, making it impossible to guarantee both consistency (all nodes have the same data) and availability (all nodes respond to requests) simultaneously. </li>
                <li>Choosing consistency: Service returns an error during network partition.</li>
                <li>Choosing availability: Data is not consistent through the whole network.</li>
                <li>Not that in reality a tradeoff can be made between consistency and availability, we don&#39;t have to choose one entirely.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When a database shall be distributed, we have to choose {{5708766922279914::Partition tolerance}} out of three quality attributes in the CAP theorem.</li>
        <li></li>
