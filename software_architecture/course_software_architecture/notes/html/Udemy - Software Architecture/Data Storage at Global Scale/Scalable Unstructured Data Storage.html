      Scalable Unstructured Data Storage
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>What is unstructured data?→Data which doesn&#39;t follow a particular structure, schema or model. For example, &quot;Blob&quot; - Binary Large Object Files, like Audio, Video or Images. Often the data sets and each file or object itself of unstructured data are large.</li>
        <li>Relational/non-relational databases are {{6528028871785729::not optimized}}  for unstructured data. They often have also a size limit for binary objects (~megabytes).</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Distributed File System (DFS)
            <ul>
                <li>Describe→A distributed file system (DFS) is a storage architecture that distributes data across multiple storage nodes. It is similar to a file system on a single computer.</li>
                <li>Benefits
                    <ul>
                        <li>No need for a special API.</li>
                        <li>Files can be modified easily.</li>
                        <li>Efficient for high-performance operations</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Limitations
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number of files is limited</li>
                        <li>No easy access through web API (HTTP+ REST)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Object Store
            <ul>
                <li>Describe→An object store is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than files or blocks. Each object contains the data itself, along with metadata and a unique identifier, allowing for easy retrieval and management.</li>
                <li>Benefits
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linear scalability</li>
                        <li>No limit to the number of objects</li>
                        <li>Very high limit on single object size (~5-10 Terabytes)</li>
                        <li>Provides an HTTP + REST API</li>
                        <li>Supports versioning out of the box</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Drawbacks
                    <ul>
                        <li>Objects are immutable, objects needs to be replaced if changed</li>
                        <li>No easy access like a file-system, access through an SDK or REST API</li>
                        <li>Lower IO performance compared to DFS</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
