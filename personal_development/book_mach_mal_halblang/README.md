## Review

⭐ 4/5 - Interesting book prompting reflection

The author of this book clearly has an extensive understanding of the subject matter, and it’s evident that the themes discussed are of great concern to them. Their honesty shines through, and I found many of the points made to be incredibly helpful, prompting deep reflection.

However, the book does have some drawbacks. At times, the structure is somewhat unclear, which can make it challenging to follow the flow of ideas. Additionally, there are moments of repetition that could have been streamlined for a more concise reading experience.

Overall, despite these minor issues, the book is thought-provoking and offers valuable insights that are definitely worth considering.

## Structure

In the *notes* folder you can find my notes from Remnote as Remnote file, markdown or html export.

## Remarks

I read the book in German, and so are my notes, but you can easily translate them using tools like DeepL or ChatGPT. Since some topics are personally more relevant to me (for example, the idea of slowing down or reducing consumption) than others (such as the emphasis on appearance), my notes are more detailed on these topics. My observations aren’t in any particular order; I’ve grouped them somewhat, as many points are scattered throughout the chapters. I intentionally avoided a chapter-based structure since there are many overlaps. Some excerpts may seem out of context and may not be immediately understandable, but I didn't want to make the notes too long.

To reinforce my understanding, I created Remnote flashcards to revisit these points regularly, although I wouldn’t describe this as a structured learning process.
