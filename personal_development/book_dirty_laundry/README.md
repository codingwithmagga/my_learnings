## Review

⭐ 4.5/5 – An Engaging and Insightful Guide to Neurodiverse Relationships

"Dirty Laundry" is a fast, engaging, and highly relatable read that offers valuable insight into navigating relationships where one partner is neurodiverse. The authors use interesting and authentic stories to illustrate common challenges, making the concepts easy to understand and empathize with.

The book is packed with nice, practical tips that feel genuinely helpful for improving communication and reducing household tension. Its strength lies in its core, recurring message: the importance of radical honesty, deep understanding, and a non-judgmental approach between partners.

Some points are revisited multiple times, which, while reinforcing the central themes of honesty and understanding, can feel slightly redundant. Additionally, while the concise format makes it a quick read, some readers might wish it was a bit longer and explored certain aspects in more depth.

Overall, it’s a compassionate and practical book that successfully demystifies neurodiversity in relationships. Highly recommended for anyone looking to strengthen their partnership with greater empathy and effective strategies.

## Remarks

To reinforce my understanding, I created Remnote flashcards to revisit these points regularly, although I wouldn’t describe this as a structured learning process.
