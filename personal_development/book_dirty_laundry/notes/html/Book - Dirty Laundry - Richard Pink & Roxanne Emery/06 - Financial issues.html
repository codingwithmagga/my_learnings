    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>Don&#39;t have credit cards.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask for help: It can be utterly overwhelming to be in debt with a pile of unopened bills. As well as devastating for your mental health. Ask for help, open one letter after another.</li>
                        <li>Open the letters: Stacks of unopened bills are far worse than whatever is hiding inside them.</li>
                        <li>Credit cards: Don&#39;t have them unless you absolutely need them for basic living expenses.</li>
                        <li>Practice: You aren&#39;t awful or stupid. It&#39;s time to practice, very slowly and ideally, with help. Save a little each month. Open an envelope. Fill a shopping cart and don&#39;t buy it. It will get better.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner:
            <ul>
                <li>Your ADHDer may be the first person to buy other people things they can&#39;t afford. </li>
                <li>It helps when the ADHDHer makes you part of the process and talks to you. This will reduce massively impulse purchases.</li>
                <li>They are searching for that hit of happiness that impulsive spending brings them. Understand this and don&#39;t shame them for this.</li>
                <li>They are responsible for their choices; we don&#39;t want to control them. We can be a lifeline if they are struggling and asking for help.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask and listen: Ask your ADHDer what their relationship with money is like and whether they have any struggles. Don&#39;t shame or blame them. </li>
                        <li>Credit cards: Offer to look after the credit cards of your partner. It is not about controlling; it is an offer to support them.</li>
                        <li>Celebrate wins: Acknowledge the behavior of choosing something on sale or a medium-priced hotel.</li>
                        <li>Help them budget: Help your ADHDer work out how much their bills are every month. Help them budget. Limit the damage they can make if possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
