      00 - How to read this book
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Newsflash: Shaming yourself or allowing others to shame you will never actually help you get better. You can&#39;t shame yourself, or be shamed, into being more functional.</li>
        <li>Show her how to do (simple) things (like making a bed), and never laugh or question it.</li>
        <li>It is not simply a book about how to support a person with ADHD. It&#39;s a book about understanding what it&#39;s truly like to love someone with ADHD, warts and all, and the tools we all can use to create a healthy and happy home for everyone affected by ADHD.</li>
