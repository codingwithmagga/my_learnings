      10 - Impulsivity
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>ADDHer has the rare ability to fail over and over again and never lose hope. When people have that kind of persistence, well, the chances of something working eventually are pretty goddamn high.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have patience: because something feels like the purpose today doesn&#39;t mean it will tomorrow. Is this something you want to do for the next 10 years? </li>
                        <li>Find your genius: Often the key to our genius will be embedded in the thing that we naturally gravitate towards. Often it is something we&#39;d love to do as a child. If you haven&#39;t found it yet, don&#39;t be discouraged.</li>
                        <li>Dream, Don&#39;t Do: Allow yourself to dream about a new idea. Get all your dopamine out of the idea using your incredible imagination, but don&#39;t quit everything else. Set yourself boundaries.</li>
                        <li>Find your team: A neurotypical person has a significant value for you. He brings different skills to the table and can help you with logic, organization, and planning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner
            <ul>
                <li>An ADHDer feels intensely for new hobbies; the impulsivity overtakes them, and they commit fully to this being their new life purpose.</li>
                <li>You can&#39;t control or stop the creative genius of the ADDHer brain. Your task is (together with the ADHD person) to decide which ideas are actually worth committing time to. </li>
                <li>The impulsivity of your ADHDer is something to protect. You can help them see when an idea might land them in trouble or what might be a stroke of genius.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don&#39;t dismiss dreams: Don&#39;t dismiss the dreams, even if they sound like the most nonsensical thing you&#39;ve ever heard. That&#39;s their experience of happiness. Chat about the ideas, have some fun yourself, maybe create a business plan.</li>
                        <li>Watch and wait: The communicating style make severything sound like the best idea ever. Be patient and wathc if the idea holfs longer than a few days or weeks.</li>
                        <li>Provide a reality check: help them to remember things like the financial implications and practicalities of their grand plans. These are the unsexy details that bring them back down to earth. If an ADHDer is willing to get into the unsexy stuff, this might be a sign of staying power.</li>
                        <li>Spot the gold: Ninety-nine of your ADHDer ideas might go down the drain, but keep your mind open for that one idea that will go into the clouds.</li>
