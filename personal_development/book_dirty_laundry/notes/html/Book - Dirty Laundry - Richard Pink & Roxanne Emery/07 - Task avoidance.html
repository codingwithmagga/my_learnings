      07 - Task avoidance

    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>It doesn&#39;t matter what the ADHD person is supposed to do; their brain will feverishly look for something -a anything - else to do and make that thing so incredibly desirable that there is no choice but to do that instead.</li>
                <li>It&#39;s about avoiding whatever it is that is most important at that time.</li>
                <li>At the very core of ADHD is an issue with attention. So it&#39;s no surprise their minds are often drifting off task.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognize: Call it out when you are doing something different: &quot;I am seriously distracted right now. I&#39;m going back to the task at hand and coming back to these later.&quot; It is building a habit to choose where your focus goes.</li>
                        <li>Do the important task first: If you have something to do, do it right now. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to find something different interesting.</li>
                        <li>Tell people: Let people around you know you have ADHD and are incredibly easily distracted. If you feel comfortable, give them the permission to call you out in a calm and kind way.</li>
                        <li>See the positives: Sometimes you do something special, useful, etc., while avoiding an important task. See the positives from this.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner
            <ul>
                <li>List of phrases that do not work if you are trying to get your partner back on task:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Just do it! I don&#39;t understand why you are delaying.</li>
                        <li>Stop painting that jacket! You are wasting time.</li>
                        <li>You know you are going to have anxiety avoiding this. What are you doing?</li>
                        <li>You&#39;ll feel better if you just get it done. Come on.</li>
                        <li>Shall I just do it for you?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It may be a bit awkward if your partner drifts off during a conversation. Don&#39;t take that personally. The ADHD mind works like that. Ask your partner to share what he/she was thinking.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gently call it out: Tell them kindly that they are off track: &quot;Looks like you are a bit distracted by now. What&#39;s going on for you?&quot;</li>
                        <li>Don&#39;t interrupt: If they are really doing what they should do, don&#39;t ask questions about anything else. They can easily be knocked off their task.</li>
                        <li>Set a time limit: If the ADHD person really can&#39;t get back to the task, set a time limit for the other task they are currently doing.</li>
                        <li>Be inquisitive: if their mind wanders off to investigate a creative or ingenious idea, listen to it. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
