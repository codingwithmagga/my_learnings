      09 - Directional Dyslexia
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>Routine and repetition are the ADHDer&#39;s best friend. The minute there is something new? Everything went down. It&#39;s like a different world. </li>
                <li>Accept yourself radically and with love. This means saying, &quot;I struggle with new places and get super-overwhelmed! It&#39;s a symptom of my ADHD, and I might need some extra support and kindness.&quot;</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual directions: Google Maps and verbal directions don&#39;t work. What helps are visual cues. </li>
                        <li>Calm down if you get confused: if you get lost and overwhelmed (like a panic attack) kicks in, take a break. Find a bench, sit down, and breathe deeply. </li>
                        <li>Plan journeys: Planning the night before really helps you visualize your journeys and reduce anxiety. Take as much information as possible and write it down.</li>
                        <li>Ask for help: Ask for help. If it&#39;s a friend or stranger. Ask for visual directions. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner
            <ul>
                <li>Accept your ADHDer exactly as they are, allowing a safe space for them to communicate their internal experiences and totally unmask. With this topic, real-world help is needed sometimes.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don&#39;t judge: Be a safe space for directional help so they always know they can call you if they are lost and need a friendly voice.</li>
                        <li>Help with planning: It&#39;s not natural for an ADHDer to plan their trip before. Remind them and offer to help.</li>
                        <li>Double-check travel times: Time blindness is an issue here. Check their travel plans and time estimations. Also add time for getting lost, too.</li>
                        <li>Help them calm down: Calm them down if they call and are lost. Let them know everything is okay, and take some deep breaths together.</li>
                    </ul>
