      03 - Hyperfocus

    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>Hyperfocus is an extremely intense ability to focus on a particular subject for a duration of time that cannot be estimated. It appears on a whim and turns off whenever it chooses. It is absolutely not the thing on which to base one&#39;s identity and future life choices.</li>
                <li>You can&#39;t control your periods of hyperfocus. All you can do is accept them, work with them, and allow them just to be.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you are/were a gifted child: It may be time to redefine yourself. You don&#39;t have to be excellent, super-intelligent, or highly creative to be worthy of love and respect.</li>
                        <li>Language matters: Using the correct language (hyperfocusing) takes the shame out of the experience and lets those around you know what&#39;s happening. You are not being crazy, lazy, or obsessive. </li>
                        <li>Beware of burnout: hours spent researching can lead to burnout. After a certain amount of time, your brain will have had enough. Take a break when needed.</li>
                        <li>Ride the wave: Do the research, dream the dream, but don&#39;t act yet! Making decisions during hyperfocus can be destructive. If an idea is persistent for a long time, and there are sensible reasons to do it. Then you can revisit your decision.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner
            <ul>
                <li>Understand that the ADHD person is on a research project. He/she may look into expensive or time-consuming options. But knowing the extreme options allows him/her to judge the value of the more realistic ones better. </li>
                <li>Check occasionally that the ADHD person is not burning out. Offer drinks and snacks.</li>
                <li>Allow them their research projects and don&#39;t judge them. It is like a hobby. Offer help if acceptable.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communicate: Figure out what your ADHDer likes to focus on, and create space for it.</li>
                        <li>Shared joy: Don&#39;t get frustrated by their research results. Instead, lean into the shared excitement about discovering something incredible and take a moment to appreciate it with them. </li>
                        <li>Boundaries: Whether it&#39;s budget or time, clear boundaries will help the ADHD person do their research.</li>
                        <li>Kind interruptions: Suggest they take a break if it starts to overwhelm them. </li>
                    </ul>
