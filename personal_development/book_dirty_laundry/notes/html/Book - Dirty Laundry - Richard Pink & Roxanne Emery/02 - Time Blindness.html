      02 - Time Blindness
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>It could also be called time optimism, leaving the house in 45 minutes but watching an hour-long Netflix episode before? Should work!</li>
                <li>Only two times: &quot;Right now&quot; and &quot;Not now&quot;. Nothing in between.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Radical Acceptance: Time doesn&#39;t work normally for you. It is important to know that how your brain perceives time is different and that time will not magically change for you.</li>
                        <li>Tell the truth: Practise being incredible honest. Tell people why your are running late. It less stressful to tell the truth than a lie.</li>
                        <li>Make a joke out of it: Share with people in a light-hearted way that you are struggling with time. It takes a lot of mental energy to hide this behavior. Share your behavior and make a bit of fun of it.</li>
                        <li>Build new habits: Pre-plan your journeys, especially the important ones. No guesstimating; buffers for unexpected delays are essential. Overestimate how long it will take to get from Point A to B. Practice makes better.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner
            <ul>
                <li>Rather than you against your partner, you should become your partner and you versus time blindness.</li>
                <li>Stop moralizing timekeeping as something that makes a person good or bad.</li>
                <li>Timekeeping is a skill that needs understanding and then practice. Creating a safe environment for the ADHD person can be a game changer.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Change the narrative: Support for better time management skills will give much better results than shaming and arguments ever will. It&#39;s a problem for both to solve rather than an issue to argue about.</li>
                        <li>Don&#39;t set them up to fail: don&#39;t set up a time and wait annoyed at home. When they give you a time, say something like, &quot;There are no expectations for you to make this time. Please let me know if you need any help planning the journey&quot;.</li>
                        <li>Use time check-ins: friendly check-ins with the ADHD person to see how they are getting on. It also works as a reminder for them. </li>
                        <li>Be a time realist: When the ADHD person thinks they can bend time, call them back to reality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
