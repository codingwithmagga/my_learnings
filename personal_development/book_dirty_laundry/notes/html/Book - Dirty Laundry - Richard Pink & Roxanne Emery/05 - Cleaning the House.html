    <ul>
        <li>For the ADHD person
            <ul>
                <li>There are many links between ADHD and addiction.</li>
                <li>Getting sober is absolutely necessary.</li>
                <li>The non-ADHD person has to do the majority of admin, organization, and domestic tasks in the house.</li>
                <li>It can help that you admit that your house will never be perfectly clean. It just needs to be okay most of the time. Your life purpose should be a super-tidy house. It is to accept yourself and be happy.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let go of the shame: No one can hate themselves into a version of themselves that they like. You are not a disgusting, awful human being.</li>
                        <li>Ask for help: Ask someone to show you, slowly and clearly, how to do things in the house.</li>
                        <li>One thing a day: Start with one thing a day, like taking a coffee cup downstairs or hanging up a T-shirt. You are more likely to succeed when starting small, and this will slowly build your self-esteem.</li>
                        <li>Patience: The trick is to make little improvements daily that will change your habits and self-beliefs over months and years.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>For the partner
            <ul>
                <li>Look at the ADHD person as someone who desperately wanted to be part of the household cleaning routine but simply couldn&#39;t. The pain for them is real.</li>
                <li>Hearing &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; can work like a magical healing potion. You can see the joy in their faces.</li>
                <li>Tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be curious, not angry: Ask your ADHDer what it feels like to stand in a messy room. Ask them if they knew where to start. It&#39;s likely that this is extremely overwhelming for them, and this leads to avoidance. Get curious about their story and experience, as opposed to projecting your own standards onto them.</li>
                        <li>Offer to teach: Your ADHDer is way more capable than they think they are, and loving, kind, clear instructions can be an absolute game changer.</li>
                        <li>Celebrate the wins: Even if it feels a bit strange saying &quot;well done&quot; to small things, do it. An ADHDer whose progress is noted and celebrated is going to build self-esteem and skills a lot more quickly than someone whose efforts are ignored. </li>
                        <li>Don&#39;t mock them: don&#39;t make fun of them. That should be clear. Be inquisitive and supportive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
