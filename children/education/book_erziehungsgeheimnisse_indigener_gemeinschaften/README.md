## Review

⭐ 5/5 – A Treasure Trove of Parenting Insights with Practical Examples

This book is packed with extremely interesting findings, skillfully blended with the author’s personal experiences and real-life examples. The summaries are clear and effective, making complex concepts easy to grasp. It offers a wealth of valuable information on child-rearing, all presented in a highly relatable and super helpful way.

My only minor critique — a complaint on a very high level — is that the structure sometimes feels slightly inconsistent, with certain sections flowing more smoothly than others. However, this doesn’t detract much from the overall quality.

Highly recommended for parents and educators looking for both theoretical knowledge and practical guidance!

## Structure

In the *notes* folder you can find my notes from Remnote as Remnote file, markdown or html export.

## Remarks

I read the book in German, and so are my notes, but you can easily translate them using tools like DeepL or ChatGPT.

To reinforce my understanding, I created Remnote flashcards to revisit these points regularly, although I wouldn’t describe this as a structured learning process.
