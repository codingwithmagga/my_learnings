## Review

⭐ 4/5 – Valuable Principles for Conscious Parenting

This book offers a very important and useful framework for parents who want to lead their family with love and intention. The core principles—such as truly getting to know your child, interacting authentically, involving your child in decisions, being open to their feedback, and fostering a spirit of cooperation—are insightful and powerfully presented. These foundational ideas are truly valuable for any parent.

I also found the glimpses into the author's professional practice to be a interesting and helpful addition, providing real-world context for the concepts being discussed.

On the downside, I found the sentence structure to be occasionally complex or difficult to follow in some sections. Furthermore, while most of the content is strong, a few chapters felt somewhat disconnected from the overall theme of the book, making the flow feel less cohesive at times.

Despite these minor issues, the core message is excellent and highly applicable. It's a very good read for any parent reflecting on their leadership role within the family.

## Structure

In the *notes* folder you can find my notes from Remnote as Remnote file, markdown or html export.

## Remarks

I read the book in German, and so are my notes, but you can easily translate them using tools like DeepL or ChatGPT.

To reinforce my understanding, I created Remnote flashcards to revisit these points regularly, although I wouldn’t describe this as a structured learning process.
