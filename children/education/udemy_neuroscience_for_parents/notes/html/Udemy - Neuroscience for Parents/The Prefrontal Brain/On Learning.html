        <li>Rethinking Academic Success &amp; Effective Learning
            <ul>
                <li>Perfection is Overrated: Straight A&#39;s are not necessary for success. There is no strong correlation between high IQ/Ivy League education and major life outcomes like wealth, relationship quality, or parenting skills. IQ only predicts about 4% of job performance.</li>
                <li>Parents &gt; School: A child&#39;s parents and community have a greater impact on their achievement than the school they attend.</li>
                <li>Two Most Effective Learning Strategies (From a Brain Perspective):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Force Mistakes: Let your child make mistakes in a safe environment (e.g., while studying with you). The emotional experience of getting something wrong and correcting it is a powerful learning tool embedded by evolution.</li>
                        <li>Retrieve Knowledge: Actively asking questions and having your child recall information strengthens the neural pathways for that knowledge, making it stick. This is more effective than passive re-reading.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Practical Tips for Parents:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Test them: After they study, quiz them to force retrieval.</li>
                        <li>Embrace failure: Let them fail with you at home to avoid failing in class.</li>
                        <li>Space it out: Repetition over time (e.g., 5 short sessions) is far better than one long cramming session.</li>
                        <li>Change locations: Studying in different places (living room, kitchen, garden) can improve retention.</li>
                        <li>Prioritize sleep: Sleep improves memory by at least 15%, along with mood and immunity. Ensure they get enough.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
