        <li>Two Quick Tricks to Stay Calm as a Parent
            <ul>
                <li>The Reality of Parenting: In an ideal world, parents are always calm and in control. In reality, stress, lack of sleep, and uncooperative kids can push anyone to the brink.</li>
                <li>Trick #1: The 10-Year Perspective
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action: Activate your prefrontal brain by imagining yourself 10 years in the future looking back at this stressful moment.</li>
                        <li>Why it works: You&#39;ll realize there&#39;s a 95% chance you won&#39;t even remember this incident, and if you do, you&#39;ll likely laugh about it. This perspective makes the current crisis feel trivial and not worth getting upset over.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Trick #2: Imagine How It Could Be Worse
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action: Actively imagine alternative, worse scenarios for the current situation.</li>
                        <li>Why it works: This forces your prefrontal brain (logic, perspective) to engage, which automatically switches off the amygdala (the threat detector that sees your kids as a danger). This re-establishes emotional balance by making you appreciate that things aren&#39;t as bad as they seem.</li>
