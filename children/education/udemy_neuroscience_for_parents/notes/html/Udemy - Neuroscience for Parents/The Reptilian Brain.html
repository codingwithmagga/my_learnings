      The Reptilian Brain

    <ul>
        <li>The Reptilian Brain
            <ul>
                <li>What It Is
                    <ul>
                        <li>Located deep in the skull, this ancient brain structure governs survival instincts (fight, flight, or freeze).</li>
                        <li>Despite the nickname &quot;reptilian brain,&quot; it’s shared by all vertebrates (not just reptiles).</li>
                        <li>Works closely with the limbic system (especially the amygdala) to process threats.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How It Works
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 Survival Responses:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fight: Confront the threat (e.g., aggression).</li>
                                <li>Flight: Escape the danger (e.g., anxiety/avoidance).</li>
                                <li>Freeze: Play dead or hide (e.g., helplessness/shutdown).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Example: A caveman facing wolves might run (flight), fight with sticks (fight), or freeze to avoid detection.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Modern-Day Activation
                    <ul>
                        <li>Still triggers in life-or-death situations (e.g., jumping away from a speeding car).</li>
                        <li>Also activates during stress (perceived threats, not real danger):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fight ⇒ Aggression (e.g., yelling after a stressful day).</li>
                                <li>Flight ⇒ Anxiety (e.g., nervousness before a test).</li>
                                <li>Freeze ⇒ Helplessness (e.g., procrastination or depression).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Reptilian Baby
            <ul>
                <li>The Newborn Brain: Overconnected and Pruned
                    <ul>
                        <li>A baby’s brain is not a blank slate—it starts with more neural connections than an adult’s.</li>
                        <li>In the first 3 months, ~90% of limbic system connections are pruned based on interactions with the environment.</li>
                        <li>The brain keeps only what’s useful, shedding excess &quot;wiring&quot; to adapt.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Dominant Reptilian Brain in Babies
                    <ul>
                        <li>The only fully operational brain structure at birth is the reptilian (primitive) brain, which governs survival instincts.</li>
                        <li>Everything is a &quot;danger&quot; to a newborn: hunger, cold, loneliness, even a wet diaper triggers a stress response (crying).</li>
                        <li>Crying is their only communication tool—it doesn’t always mean sadness but can signal:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flight: &quot;Get me out of this!&quot; (discomfort)</li>
                                <li>Fight: &quot;I’m furious!&quot; (hunger/pain)</li>
                                <li>Freeze: &quot;I’m scared!&quot; (need for security)</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How to Respond to Infant Stress
                    <ul>
                        <li>Under age 2: The best way to calm a stressed baby is to meet their need (e.g., change a diaper, feed them). Comfort alone won’t resolve fight/flight triggers.</li>
                        <li>Avoid misinterpreting cries: A baby turning redder when comforted may be in fight stress—they need resolution, not just soothing.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Stress in Older Children and Teens
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kids lack a mature prefrontal cortex (fully developed at ~24 years), so they struggle to &quot;put things in perspective.&quot;
                            <ul>
                                <li>A broken toy feels like a catastrophe because their brain can’t rationalize it yet.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Recognizing stress responses:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flight: Avoiding eye contact, fidgeting.</li>
                                <li>Fight: Stomping, clenched jaws.</li>
                                <li>Freeze: Tears, apathy.</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Stress-Relief Strategies
                    <ul>
                        <li>NBA Guidelines: Align with the child’s emotional state.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flight: Offer choices, use humor.</li>
                                <li>Fight: Validate anger (&quot;I’d be mad too!&quot;).</li>
                                <li>Freeze: Quiet support (no pep talks).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The &quot;Hug Response&quot;:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hugs release oxytocin (the bonding hormone), reducing heart rate and stress.</li>
                                <li>Even during conflicts, offering a hug can defuse tension over time.</li>
                                <li>Key insight: Physical connection helps rewire stress patterns.</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When NOT to &quot;Give In&quot;
                    <ul>
                        <li>This approach applies only when the reptilian brain is active (perceived danger).</li>
                        <li>Once the child’s paleolimbic brain (social/emotional center) engages, boundaries and guidance become essential (covered in the next lecture).</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Final Note: Parenting infants and young children is about meeting survival needs first, then gradually teaching emotional regulation as their brain matures. Hugs aren’t a reward for tantrums—they’re a tool to exit survival mode and reconnect.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>On Movement
            <ul>
                <li>The Misunderstood &quot;Primitive&quot; Brain
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not primitive, but primal: It’s the oldest part of the brain evolutionarily, but its functions are far from basic.</li>
                        <li>Critical roles: regulates heartbeat, breathing, body temperature, sleep, and movement coordination.</li>
                        <li>Without it, we couldn’t survive—it’s the foundation for all higher brain functions.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Why Do We Even Have a Brain?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Surprising answer: The brain evolved primarily to coordinate movement, not for abstract thinking.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Plants don’t move (no brain); </li>
                                <li>Even simple animals (like worms) developed nervous systems to wiggle.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Proof: The cerebellum (&quot;small brain&quot;):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only 10% of brain volume but contains 50% of all neurons.</li>
                                <li>Controls balance, motor skills, and muscle coordination.</li>
                                <li>Evolved 400 million years ago (vs. humans’ 300,000-year existence).</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Movement is brain fuel for kids
                    <ul>
                        <li>Babies’ cerebellums grow rapidly in their first 3 months as they learn to move.</li>
                        <li>Modern problem: We force kids to sit still (school, TV) despite their brains being wired for constant motion.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Criticizing kids for fidgeting ignores biology—movement is natural and healthy.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Key insight: A sedentary lifestyle stifles brain development.</li>

                <li>Actionable Advice
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prioritize movement:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Outdoor play, sports, running—anything but prolonged sitting.</li>
                                <li>Limit screen time (more on this later).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Reframe expectations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Restlessness isn’t disobedience; it’s the brain’s demand for activity.</li>
                                <li>Movement isn’t just for fitness—it’s essential for neural growth.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A study found that climbing trees improves working memory by 50%—the mental &quot;scratchpad&quot; we use for problem-solving and learning.</li>
                        <li>Why? Each step forces the brain to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Continuously update spatial awareness.</li>
                                <li>Adapt to unpredictable terrain (branches, balance)</li>
                                <li>Coordinate complex movements in real time.</li>
                                <li></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Balancing on beams (or curbs/logs).</li>
                        <li>Carrying awkward objects (e.g., a wobbly stack of toys).</li>
                        <li>Navigating obstacle courses (natural or DIY).</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Modern life lacks 3D movement—climbing trees is a full-body, brain-engaging workout.</li>

                <li>The Hypothalamus: Hunger’s Control Center
                    <ul>
                        <li>The hypothalamus (in the primal brain) regulates:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hunger/thirst (survival instincts).</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Why it matters: The brain consumes 20% of the body’s energy despite being only 2% of its weight.</li>

                        <li>A baby’s brain grows to 55% of adult size in 3 months—requiring massive omega-3 intake.</li>
                        <li>Breastmilk quality matters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A 2014 study tied omega-3 levels in breastmilk to higher academic performance (outranking school funding!).</li>
                                <li>Mother’s diet = baby’s brain fuel. Supplements don’t match whole foods.</li>

                        <li>Skip sugary drinks/snacks: Opt for water, nuts, fruit.</li>
                        <li>Mediterranean diet ideal: Olive oil, fish, fresh produce.</li>

                        <li>Evolution’s clue: Despite making us vulnerable, sleep persists because its benefits far outweigh the risks.</li>
                        <li>Not just &quot;rest&quot;: The brain is more active during sleep than in some waking hours—performing critical maintenance:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Memory consolidation (organizing daily learning).</li>
                                <li>Toxin removal (like a nightly &quot;brain wash&quot;).</li>

                        <li>5-year-olds: 11 hours/night ⇒ Supports rapid neural growth.</li>
                        <li>9-year-olds: ≥10 hour ⇒ Essential for focus and emotional regulation.</li>
                        <li>Teens: 8–10 hour ⇒ Myelination (upgrading brain wiring) peaks during adolescence.</li>
                        <li></li>

                        <li>Emotional dysregulation:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Overactive amygdala (fear/aggression center) ⇒ tantrums, irritability, anxiety.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Rituals matter: Warm bath ⇒ lullaby  consistent bedtime.</li>

                        <li>Teens:

                                <li>Discipline &gt; duration: Fixed bed/wake times (even weekends) beat &quot;catch-up&quot; sleep.</li>
                                <li>Pro tip: Encourage a no-screens policy 1 hour before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin).</li>

                        <li>Studies suggest regular sleep schedules correlate with academic success—not just from rest, but from the self-discipline required to maintain them.</li>
                        <li>Parenting hack: Frame bedtime routines as &quot;brain training&quot; (e.g., &quot;Tonight’s sleep will help you crush that test!&quot;).</li>

                                        <li>More independent (confidence to explore, knowing their &quot;safe base&quot; is nearby).</li>

                                <li>Risk: Bed-sharing can increase SIDS (5x higher in some studies).</li>
                                <li>Safer alternative: Room-sharing (crib/bassinet next to parents’ bed).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
