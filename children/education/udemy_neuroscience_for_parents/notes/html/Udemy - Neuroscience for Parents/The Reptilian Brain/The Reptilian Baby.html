      The Reptilian Baby
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The Newborn Brain: Overconnected and Pruned
            <ul>
                <li>A baby’s brain is not a blank slate—it starts with more neural connections than an adult’s.</li>
                <li>In the first 3 months, ~90% of limbic system connections are pruned based on interactions with the environment.</li>
                <li>The brain keeps only what’s useful, shedding excess &quot;wiring&quot; to adapt.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Dominant Reptilian Brain in Babies
            <ul>
                <li>The only fully operational brain structure at birth is the reptilian (primitive) brain, which governs survival instincts.</li>
                <li>Everything is a &quot;danger&quot; to a newborn: hunger, cold, loneliness, even a wet diaper triggers a stress response (crying).</li>
                <li>Crying is their only communication tool—it doesn’t always mean sadness but can signal:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flight: &quot;Get me out of this!&quot; (discomfort)</li>
                        <li>Fight: &quot;I’m furious!&quot; (hunger/pain)</li>
                        <li>Freeze: &quot;I’m scared!&quot; (need for security)</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How to Respond to Infant Stress
            <ul>
                <li>Under age 2: The best way to calm a stressed baby is to meet their need (e.g., change a diaper, feed them). Comfort alone won’t resolve fight/flight triggers.</li>
                <li>Avoid misinterpreting cries: A baby turning redder when comforted may be in fight stress—they need resolution, not just soothing.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stress in Older Children and Teens
            <ul>
                <li>Kids lack a mature prefrontal cortex (fully developed at ~24 years), so they struggle to &quot;put things in perspective.&quot;
                    <ul>
                        <li>A broken toy feels like a catastrophe because their brain can’t rationalize it yet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Recognizing stress responses:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flight: Avoiding eye contact, fidgeting.</li>
                        <li>Fight: Stomping, clenched jaws.</li>
                        <li>Freeze: Tears, apathy.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stress-Relief Strategies
            <ul>
                <li>NBA Guidelines: Align with the child’s emotional state.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flight: Offer choices, use humor.</li>
                        <li>Fight: Validate anger (&quot;I’d be mad too!&quot;).</li>
                        <li>Freeze: Quiet support (no pep talks).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The &quot;Hug Response&quot;:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hugs release oxytocin (the bonding hormone), reducing heart rate and stress.</li>
                        <li>Even during conflicts, offering a hug can defuse tension over time.</li>
                        <li>Key insight: Physical connection helps rewire stress patterns.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When NOT to &quot;Give In&quot;
            <ul>
                <li>This approach applies only when the reptilian brain is active (perceived danger).</li>
                <li>Once the child’s paleolimbic brain (social/emotional center) engages, boundaries and guidance become essential (covered in the next lecture).</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Final Note: Parenting infants and young children is about meeting survival needs first, then gradually teaching emotional regulation as their brain matures. Hugs aren’t a reward for tantrums—they’re a tool to exit survival mode and reconnect.</li>
