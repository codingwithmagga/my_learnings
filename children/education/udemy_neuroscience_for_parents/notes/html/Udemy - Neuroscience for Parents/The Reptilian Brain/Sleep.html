        <li>Why Sleep is Non-Negotiable
            <ul>
                <li>Evolution’s clue: Despite making us vulnerable, sleep persists because its benefits far outweigh the risks.</li>
                <li>Not just &quot;rest&quot;: The brain is more active during sleep than in some waking hours—performing critical maintenance:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory consolidation (organizing daily learning).</li>
                        <li>Toxin removal (like a nightly &quot;brain wash&quot;).</li>
                        <li>Construction/maturation (especially in kids).</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sleep Needs by Age
            <ul>
                <li>Babies (0–1 year): ~14 hours/day ⇒ Building their brain from scratch.</li>
                <li>5-year-olds: 11 hours/night ⇒ Supports rapid neural growth.</li>
                <li>9-year-olds: ≥10 hour ⇒ Essential for focus and emotional regulation.</li>
                <li>Teens: 8–10 hour ⇒ Myelination (upgrading brain wiring) peaks during adolescence.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Consequences of Sleep Deprivation
            <ul>
                <li>Academic struggles: Poor focus ⇒ weak memory  lower grades.</li>
                <li>Emotional dysregulation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overactive amygdala (fear/aggression center) ⇒ tantrums, irritability, anxiety.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Long-term risks: Linked to depression, aggression, and cognitive decline.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How to Foster Healthy Sleep
            <ul>
                <li>Babies/Toddlers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rituals matter: Warm bath ⇒ lullaby  consistent bedtime.</li>
                        <li>Predictability signals the brain to &quot;wind down.&quot;</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Teens:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discipline &gt; duration: Fixed bed/wake times (even weekends) beat &quot;catch-up&quot; sleep.</li>
                        <li>Pro tip: Encourage a no-screens policy 1 hour before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin).</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Discipline Connection
            <ul>
                <li>Studies suggest regular sleep schedules correlate with academic success—not just from rest, but from the self-discipline required to maintain them.</li>
                <li>Parenting hack: Frame bedtime routines as &quot;brain training&quot; (e.g., &quot;Tonight’s sleep will help you crush that test!&quot;).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
