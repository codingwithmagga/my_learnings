      On Co-sleeping
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>The Biological Norm
            <ul>
                <li>Humans are the only mammals that don’t routinely sleep with their young—every other species does.</li>
                <li>Evolutionary perspective: Close contact at night promotes safety, bonding, and emotional security.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Debunking Myths
            <ul>
                <li>Myth: &quot;Co-sleeping creates clingy, insecure kids.&quot;
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reality: Studies show opposite results—children who co-sleep (on their terms) tend to be:
                            <ul>
                                <li>More independent (confidence to explore, knowing their &quot;safe base&quot; is nearby).</li>
                                <li>Fewer behavioral issues (less anxiety, better emotional regulation).</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Risks vs. Benefits
            <ul>
                <li>For babies (&lt;1 year):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Risk: Bed-sharing can increase SIDS (5x higher in some studies).</li>
                        <li>Safer alternative: Room-sharing (crib/bassinet next to parents’ bed).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For toddlers/kids:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Benefits: Comfort, emotional connection, easier nighttime soothing.</li>
                        <li>Parental trade-off: Disrupted sleep (kicks, rolling, etc.).</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Practical Solutions
            <ul>
                <li>The &quot;Hybrid&quot; Rule (tested by Gregory’s family):
                    <ul>
                        <li>&quot;Everyone starts the night in their own bed. If you wake up, you can join us.&quot;</li>
                        <li>Why it works:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Teaches independent sleep initiation.</li>
                                <li>Allows comfort-seeking after waking (best of both worlds).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Consistency is key:
                    <ul>
                        <li>No exceptions = no confusion. Kids adapt quickly when boundaries are clear.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Parental Well-Being Matters
            <ul>
                <li>If co-sleeping drains you: It’s okay to prioritize your sleep (happy parent = happy child).</li>
                <li>Cultural note: In many societies (e.g., Japan), family beds are the norm—proof there’s no &quot;one right way.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
