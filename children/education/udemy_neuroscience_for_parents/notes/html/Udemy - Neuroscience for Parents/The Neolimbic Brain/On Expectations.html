    <ul>
        <li>The Pygmalion Effect &amp; Setting Expectations
            <ul>
                <li>Children are highly attuned to expectations: They are experts at picking up subtle clues (words, gestures, attitudes) to understand what their parents and teachers expect from them, and they will subconsciously live up to those expectations.</li>
                <li>The Pygmalion Effect (Self-Fulfilling Prophecy): This is a well-studied and proven psychological phenomenon where higher expectations lead to an increase in performance.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: In studies, teachers were given a random list of students falsely labeled as &quot;high-potential.&quot; By the end of the year, those specific students showed the most improvement, even though teachers were told not to show favoritism. Their unconscious belief in the students&#39; potential made it a reality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Golem Effect (The Negative Side): The inverse is also true. Low expectations and negative stereotypes lead to poorer performance. This explains how stigmatization can hold children back.</li>
                <li>How to Be Demanding the Right Way: The key is not to be demanding about results (which can create insecurity and a sense that love is conditional), but to be demanding about effort and attitude.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus on the process: Praise hard work, perseverance, and the willingness to try.</li>
                        <li>Normalize mistakes: Teach that errors are a normal part of learning.</li>
                        <li>Let them set the bar: Discuss expectations with your children, guide them to challenge themselves, and help them see their own potential. This gives them control and ownership over their success.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Core Message: A parent&#39;s belief in their child&#39;s potential is a powerful force. Looking at a child with love, compassion, and a belief in what they can become will directly help them achieve it.</li>
