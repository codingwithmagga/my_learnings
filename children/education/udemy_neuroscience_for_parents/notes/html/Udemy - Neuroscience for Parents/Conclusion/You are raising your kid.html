        <li>Key Takeaways
            <ul>
                <li>You should not be too hard on yourself if things do not go as planned.</li>
                <li>Raising a child is a team effort.</li>
                <li>You have significant influence by assembling this &quot;team&quot; through your choices (e.g., neighborhood, school, media supervision).</li>
                <li>It is good for a child to be exposed to different voices, opinions, and ways of doing things.</li>
                <li>This exposure allows them to express different parts of their personality with different people.</li>
                <li>Children must learn to make their own choices; making all choices for them prevents this.</li>
                <li>Through all these experiences, children learn to make up their own minds about their life, behavior, and friendships.</li>
                <li>The ultimate goal of education is to give a child the awareness and strength of mind to make their own choices.</li>
