      The perfect parent
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Kids are not that easily traumatized.</li>
        <li>You cannot and should not protect children from everything.</li>
        <li>Children need to learn how to deal with failure and pain.</li>
        <li>As a parent, you will make errors and fail.</li>
        <li>There will be moments of stress or clumsiness that lead to regret.</li>
        <li>This is no big deal because nobody is perfect.</li>
        <li>Parenting is difficult; there is no manual, and all kids are different.</li>
        <li>What works with one child will not work with another.</li>
        <li>Parenting is often chaos, drama, and tears.</li>
        <li>Parents who stay home to raise small kids are at high risk for burnout.</li>
        <li>You should not put an extra burden on yourself with unrealistic expectations.</li>
        <li>You will make mistakes, and that is okay.</li>
