      How to take this course

    <ul>
        <li>The Challenges and Rewards of Parenting
            <ul>
                <li>Studies show that couples without children report higher happiness levels than those with kids—at least while the children are still living at home. Parenting is hard, with sleepless nights, stress, and conflicts.</li>
                <li>But there’s good news: A recent study found that parents whose children have moved out are ultimately happier than childless couples. The struggles do pay off in the long run.</li>
                <li>Why is parenting so tough? Because children’s brains work differently than adults’. They don’t reason, behave, or process emotions the same way. Understanding this can make parenting feel less frustrating.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                    </ul>
