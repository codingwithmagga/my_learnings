        <li>Importance of Neuroscience for Parents
            <ul>
                <li>A child’s brain development is significantly shaped by their environment and experiences, especially in their early years.</li>
                <li>Studies show that the quality of care at just 3.5 years old can predict with 77% accuracy whether a child will later drop out of high school.</li>
                <li>Parents have a dual responsibility: They determine 50% of their child’s genes and shape their environment, which in turn influences gene activation.</li>
                <li></li>

        <li>Extreme Effects of Neglect
            <ul>
                <li>An extreme example shows that severe neglect can lead to massive cortical atrophy (brain shrinkage).</li>
                <li>However, everyday parenting mistakes (e.g., occasional yelling) do not have such drastic consequences.</li>

        <li>How Parenthood Affects the Parent’s Brain
            <ul>
                <li>Parents experience reduced neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) due to stress.</li>
                <li>In pregnant women, the brain temporarily shrinks but returns to normal size after birth.</li>
                <li>Oxytocin (the &quot;bonding hormone&quot;) and vasopressin play a key role:
                    <ul>
                        <li>They strengthen the bond with the child.</li>
                        <li>They trigger neural reorganization, helping parents adapt to new challenges.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Goals of the &quot;Neuroscience for Parents&quot; Course
            <ul>
                <li>Parents will learn how to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Control their own emotions in challenging situations.</li>
                        <li>Recognize which part of their child’s brain is active and adjust communication accordingly.</li>
                        <li>Respond appropriately to behaviors to support balanced personality development.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
