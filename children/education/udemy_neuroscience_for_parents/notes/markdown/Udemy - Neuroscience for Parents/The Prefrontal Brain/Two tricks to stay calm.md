- Two Quick Tricks to Stay Calm as a Parent
    - The Reality of Parenting: In an ideal world, parents are always calm and in control. In reality, stress, lack of sleep, and uncooperative kids can push anyone to the brink.
    - Trick #1: The 10-Year Perspective
        - Action: Activate your prefrontal brain by imagining yourself 10 years in the future looking back at this stressful moment.
        - Why it works: You'll realize there's a 95% chance you won't even remember this incident, and if you do, you'll likely laugh about it. This perspective makes the current crisis feel trivial and not worth getting upset over.
    - Trick #2: Imagine How It Could Be Worse
        - Action: Actively imagine alternative, worse scenarios for the current situation.
        - Why it works: This forces your prefrontal brain (logic, perspective) to engage, which automatically switches off the amygdala (the threat detector that sees your kids as a danger). This re-establishes emotional balance by making you appreciate that things aren't as bad as they seem.
