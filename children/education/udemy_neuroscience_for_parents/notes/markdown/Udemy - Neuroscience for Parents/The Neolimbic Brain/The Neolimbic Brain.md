- Role of the Neolimbic Brain
    - Central hub for emotions, memories, and motivations.
    - Acts as an autopilotâ€”stores routines (e.g., walking, social codes) to free up mental energy.
    - Records all life experiences (good and bad).
    - 
- Three Layers of Motivation
    - (A) Intrinsic Motivations (Layer 1)
        - Fixed from infancy (shaped by genes + early environment).
        - Source of joy and energy (e.g., cleaning a room for fun).
        - Forms core personality (aligned with 8 NBA personality types).
    - (B) Extrinsic Motivations (Layer 2)
        - Learned from environment (family, culture, media).
        - Unstable and draining (e.g., studying to avoid punishment).
        - Fades without external rewards or validation.
    - (C) Obsessions (Layer 3)
        - Compensate for emotional voids (e.g., obsessive love, workaholism).
        - Tip beyond passion into addiction (e.g., stalking, extremism).
        - Lead to loss of freedom and perpetual dissatisfaction.
        - 
- Key Contrasts
    - Intrinsic: Sustainable, self-driven (e.g., pursuing a dream job).
    - Extrinsic: Short-lived, externally pressured (e.g., chasing a high salary for approval).
    - Obsessions: Destructive, compulsive (e.g., addiction to drugs, gambling, or ideologies).
    - 
- Why It Matters
    - Living by extrinsic motives or obsessions breeds frustration and emptiness.
    - Intrinsic alignment is key to lasting fulfillment.
