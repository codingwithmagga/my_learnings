- Importance of Neuroscience for Parents
    - A child’s brain development is significantly shaped by their environment and experiences, especially in their early years.
    - Studies show that the quality of care at just 3.5 years old can predict with 77% accuracy whether a child will later drop out of high school.
    - Parents have a dual responsibility: They determine 50% of their child’s genes and shape their environment, which in turn influences gene activation.

- Extreme Effects of Neglect
    - An extreme example shows that severe neglect can lead to massive cortical atrophy (brain shrinkage).
    - However, everyday parenting mistakes (e.g., occasional yelling) do not have such drastic consequences.

- How Parenthood Affects the Parent’s Brain
    - Parents experience reduced neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) due to stress.
    - In pregnant women, the brain temporarily shrinks but returns to normal size after birth.
    - Oxytocin (the "bonding hormone") and vasopressin play a key role:
        - They strengthen the bond with the child.
        - They trigger neural reorganization, helping parents adapt to new challenges.

- Goals of the "Neuroscience for Parents" Course
    - Parents will learn how to:
        - Control their own emotions in challenging situations.
        - Recognize which part of their child’s brain is active and adjust communication accordingly.
        - Respond appropriately to behaviors to support balanced personality development.
