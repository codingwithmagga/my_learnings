- Core Function
    - Purpose: Ensures group survival (vs. the reptilian brain’s focus on individual survival).
    - Key Roles: Governs self-confidence and trust in others—dictating how we position ourselves socially.

- The Two Axes of Social Behavior
    - (A) Self-Confidence Spectrum
        - Assertiveness (Balanced):
            - Healthy self-worth: can say yes or no without guilt.
        - Dominance (Excess):
            - "I deserve more than others" ⇒ manipulative charm ⇒ narcissism (extreme).
            - Tactic: Uses people as tools for personal gain
        - Submissiveness (Deficit):
            - "I’m unlucky/broken" ⇒ blames self for failures ⇒ melancholic depression (extreme).
    - (B) Trust Spectrum
        - Assertiveness (Balanced):
            - Rational trust; questions absurd claims (e.g., scams).
        - Marginality (Deficit):
            - Distrust ⇒ conspiracy theories ⇒ paranoia (extreme).
        - Acquiescence (Excess):
            - Blind trust ⇒ gullibility (e.g., falling for scams) ⇒ mystical delirium (extreme).

- How It Operates
    - Territorial & Power-Driven:
        - Dominant behaviors (peacocking, bullying) aim to intimidate but back down against firm resistance.
        - Why? Like animals, the paleolimbic brain avoids prolonged conflict (too risky).
    - Slow to Change:
        - Self-confidence/trust levels evolve gradually (no "quick fixes").
        - Exception: Trauma can shatter confidence instantly (but never boost it rapidly).
