- The Problem: A Gentle Child Targeted
    - My 3-year-old son was hiding in his room, afraid to go to school.
    - The bully: A classmate hitting him (and others) randomly.
    - Teacher’s warning: "Your son’s gentle, introverted nature makes him an ideal target."
    - 
- Parental Panic (and Bad Ideas)
    - First reactions:
        - Mom’s idea: Martial arts lessons.
        - Dad’s idea: Teach him to run faster.
        - Considered: Changing schools.
        - 
    - Neuroscience wake-up call:
        - Bullying is dominant limbic behavior (intimidation = power)
        - Key insight: If intimidation fails, bullying stops.
        - 
- The "No, No, No" Method
    - Role-playing at home:
        - Practiced standing tall, making angry faces, and pointing while shouting "No, no, no!"
        - Goal: Teach his brain to assert boundaries (not fight back).
        - 
    - Why it worked:
        - Bullies prey on fear/submission—assertiveness disrupts their script.
        - Result: After 2 weeks, the bully backed down when confronted.
        - 
- 4The Genius Twist: Befriending the Bully
    - Mom’s Machiavellian masterstroke: Invite the bully over to play.
        - My reaction: "The devil incarnate in our house?!"
        - Her logic: Social bonding rewires behavior.
        - 
    - Outcome:
        - They became best friends within months.
        - The ex-bully stopped targeting others (friendship = social validation).
        - My son’s confidence soared—he learned to navigate conflict without violence.

- Neuroscience Lessons for Parents
    - For bullied kids:
        - Assertiveness > aggression: Teach them to hold space (e.g., "No!" + eye contact).
        - Role-play at home: Make it a game to reduce fear.
        - 
    - For bullies:
        - Loneliness fuels dominance: Many bullies lack social skills—friendship can rechannel their need for power.
        - 
    - For schools:
        - Teachers: Reward positive interactions (e.g., "I saw you share—that’s leadership!").
        - 
- Key Quote:
    - "Bullying is a dance—if one partner stops following the steps, the dance falls apart."
