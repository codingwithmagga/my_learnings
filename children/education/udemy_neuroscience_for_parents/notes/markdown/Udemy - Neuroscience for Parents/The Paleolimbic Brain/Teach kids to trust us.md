- The Original Marshmallow Test (Walter Mischel)
    - Kids offered 1 marshmallow now or 2 marshmallows later if they waited.
    - Results:
        - Some ate it immediately.
        - Some tried to wait but gave in.
        - A few resisted temptation and doubled their reward.
    - 12-Year Follow-Up: Kids who waited had:
        - Better grades
        - Lower drug use
        - Healthier weight

- The 2012 Revelation (Celeste Kidd)
    - Willpower isnâ€™t the only factorâ€”trust in the environment matters more.
    - Kids from unstable/unreliable backgrounds ate the marshmallow sooner (why wait if rewards might disappear?).
    - Kids from stable/trustworthy homes waited (confidence that delayed rewards will come).

    - âœ… For Parents:
        - Keep promises: If you say "weâ€™ll get ice cream after homework," follow through.
        - Make them earn rewards: "You can play video games after you clean your room."
        - Enforce consequences: If they break a rule, calmly apply the pre-warned consequence (no empty threats).
    - ðŸš« Avoid:
        - Giving in to begging/whining (teaches "persistence pays off NOW").
        - Inconsistent rules (creates a "grab what you can" mindset).
        - 
- Why This Matters
    - A childâ€™s early worldview ("Can I trust the future?") shapes lifelong habits:
        - Studying vs. procrastinating
        - Saving money vs. impulsive spending
        - Commitment in relationships vs. short-term gratification
    - Rewiring is possibleâ€”but itâ€™s easier to build the right foundation early.
