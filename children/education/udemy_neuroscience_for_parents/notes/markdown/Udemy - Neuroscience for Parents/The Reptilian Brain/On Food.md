- The Hypothalamus: Hunger’s Control Center
    - The hypothalamus (in the primal brain) regulates:
        - Hunger/thirst (survival instincts).
        - Appetite (from a newborn’s cries to a teen’s bottomless stomach).
    - Why it matters: The brain consumes 20% of the body’s energy despite being only 2% of its weight.

- Brain Food: Omega-3s & Healthy Fats
    - 60% of the brain’s dry weight is fat—omega-3s (DHA/EPA) are critical for:
        - Neuron formation.
        - Memory, focus, and mood regulation.
    - Best sources:
        - Fatty fish (salmon, sardines).
        - Nuts/seeds (walnuts, flaxseeds, chia).
        - Grass-fed dairy/eggs (industrial feed strips omega-3s).
    - Avoid: Processed fats (fast food grease) and excess sugar (harms neurogenesis).
    - 
- Babies & Breastmilk: The Omega-3 Link
    - A baby’s brain grows to 55% of adult size in 3 months—requiring massive omega-3 intake.
    - Breastmilk quality matters:
        - A 2014 study tied omega-3 levels in breastmilk to higher academic performance (outranking school funding!).
        - Mother’s diet = baby’s brain fuel. Supplements don’t match whole foods.

- Toxins to Avoid
    - Alcohol during pregnancy: Slows fetal neurogenesis ⇒ cognitive impairment.
        - Conception tip: Drinking pre-pregnancy (at 1-cell stage) is low-risk—no neurons exist yet.
    - Sugar’s damage:
        - Reduces new neuron growth.
        - Triggers dopamine spikes (addictive).
        - Weakens impulse control + memory.

- Parenting Food Habits
    - Kids mimic diets: Serve veggies early/often to cultivate taste.
    - Skip sugary drinks/snacks: Opt for water, nuts, fruit.
    - Mediterranean diet ideal: Olive oil, fish, fresh produce.
