- The Biological Norm
    - Humans are the only mammals that don’t routinely sleep with their young—every other species does.
    - Evolutionary perspective: Close contact at night promotes safety, bonding, and emotional security.
    - 
- Debunking Myths
    - Myth: "Co-sleeping creates clingy, insecure kids."
        - Reality: Studies show opposite results—children who co-sleep (on their terms) tend to be:
            - More independent (confidence to explore, knowing their "safe base" is nearby).
            - Fewer behavioral issues (less anxiety, better emotional regulation).
            - 
- Risks vs. Benefits
    - For babies (<1 year):
        - Risk: Bed-sharing can increase SIDS (5x higher in some studies).
        - Safer alternative: Room-sharing (crib/bassinet next to parents’ bed).
    - For toddlers/kids:
        - Benefits: Comfort, emotional connection, easier nighttime soothing.
        - Parental trade-off: Disrupted sleep (kicks, rolling, etc.).

- Practical Solutions
    - The "Hybrid" Rule (tested by Gregory’s family):
        - "Everyone starts the night in their own bed. If you wake up, you can join us."
        - Why it works:
            - Teaches independent sleep initiation.
            - Allows comfort-seeking after waking (best of both worlds).
    - Consistency is key:
        - No exceptions = no confusion. Kids adapt quickly when boundaries are clear.
        - 
- Parental Well-Being Matters
    - If co-sleeping drains you: It’s okay to prioritize your sleep (happy parent = happy child).
    - Cultural note: In many societies (e.g., Japan), family beds are the norm—proof there’s no "one right way."
