- Why Sleep is Non-Negotiable
    - Evolution’s clue: Despite making us vulnerable, sleep persists because its benefits far outweigh the risks.
    - Not just "rest": The brain is more active during sleep than in some waking hours—performing critical maintenance:
        - Memory consolidation (organizing daily learning).
        - Toxin removal (like a nightly "brain wash").
        - Construction/maturation (especially in kids).
        - 
- Sleep Needs by Age
    - Babies (0–1 year): ~14 hours/day ⇒ Building their brain from scratch.
    - 5-year-olds: 11 hours/night ⇒ Supports rapid neural growth.
    - 9-year-olds: ≥10 hour ⇒ Essential for focus and emotional regulation.
    - Teens: 8–10 hour ⇒ Myelination (upgrading brain wiring) peaks during adolescence.

- Consequences of Sleep Deprivation
    - Academic struggles: Poor focus ⇒ weak memory  lower grades.
    - Emotional dysregulation:
        - Overactive amygdala (fear/aggression center) ⇒ tantrums, irritability, anxiety.
    - Long-term risks: Linked to depression, aggression, and cognitive decline.

- How to Foster Healthy Sleep
    - Babies/Toddlers:
        - Rituals matter: Warm bath ⇒ lullaby  consistent bedtime.
        - Predictability signals the brain to "wind down."
    - Teens:
        - Discipline > duration: Fixed bed/wake times (even weekends) beat "catch-up" sleep.
        - Pro tip: Encourage a no-screens policy 1 hour before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin).
        - 
- The Discipline Connection
    - Studies suggest regular sleep schedules correlate with academic success—not just from rest, but from the self-discipline required to maintain them.
    - Parenting hack: Frame bedtime routines as "brain training" (e.g., "Tonight’s sleep will help you crush that test!").
