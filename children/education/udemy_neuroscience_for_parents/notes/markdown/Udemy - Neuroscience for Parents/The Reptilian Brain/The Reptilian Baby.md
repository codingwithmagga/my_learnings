- The Newborn Brain: Overconnected and Pruned
    - A baby’s brain is not a blank slate—it starts with more neural connections than an adult’s.
    - In the first 3 months, ~90% of limbic system connections are pruned based on interactions with the environment.
    - The brain keeps only what’s useful, shedding excess "wiring" to adapt.
    - 
- The Dominant Reptilian Brain in Babies
    - The only fully operational brain structure at birth is the reptilian (primitive) brain, which governs survival instincts.
    - Everything is a "danger" to a newborn: hunger, cold, loneliness, even a wet diaper triggers a stress response (crying).
    - Crying is their only communication tool—it doesn’t always mean sadness but can signal:
        - Flight: "Get me out of this!" (discomfort)
        - Fight: "I’m furious!" (hunger/pain)
        - Freeze: "I’m scared!" (need for security)
        - 
- How to Respond to Infant Stress
    - Under age 2: The best way to calm a stressed baby is to meet their need (e.g., change a diaper, feed them). Comfort alone won’t resolve fight/flight triggers.
    - Avoid misinterpreting cries: A baby turning redder when comforted may be in fight stress—they need resolution, not just soothing.

- Stress in Older Children and Teens
    - Kids lack a mature prefrontal cortex (fully developed at ~24 years), so they struggle to "put things in perspective."
        - A broken toy feels like a catastrophe because their brain can’t rationalize it yet.
    - Recognizing stress responses:
        - Flight: Avoiding eye contact, fidgeting.
        - Fight: Stomping, clenched jaws.
        - Freeze: Tears, apathy.
        - 
- Stress-Relief Strategies
    - NBA Guidelines: Align with the child’s emotional state.
        - Flight: Offer choices, use humor.
        - Fight: Validate anger ("I’d be mad too!").
        - Freeze: Quiet support (no pep talks).
    - The "Hug Response":
        - Hugs release oxytocin (the bonding hormone), reducing heart rate and stress.
        - Even during conflicts, offering a hug can defuse tension over time.
        - Key insight: Physical connection helps rewire stress patterns.
        - 
- When NOT to "Give In"
    - This approach applies only when the reptilian brain is active (perceived danger).
    - Once the child’s paleolimbic brain (social/emotional center) engages, boundaries and guidance become essential (covered in the next lecture).
    - 
- Final Note: Parenting infants and young children is about meeting survival needs first, then gradually teaching emotional regulation as their brain matures. Hugs aren’t a reward for tantrums—they’re a tool to exit survival mode and reconnect.
