- The Science Behind It
    - A study found that climbing trees improves working memory by 50%—the mental "scratchpad" we use for problem-solving and learning.
    - Why? Each step forces the brain to:
        - Continuously update spatial awareness.
        - Adapt to unpredictable terrain (branches, balance)
        - Coordinate complex movements in real time.
        - 
- Beyond Trees: Dynamic Activities That Help
    - Balancing on beams (or curbs/logs).
    - Carrying awkward objects (e.g., a wobbly stack of toys).
    - Navigating obstacle courses (natural or DIY).
    - Unpredictable movement > repetitive drills (e.g., soccer drills vs. free play).
    - 
- Why This Matters for Kids (and You!)
    - Working memory is critical for:
        - Academic success (following instructions, math, reading).
        - Emotional regulation (pausing before reacting).
    - Modern life lacks 3D movement—climbing trees is a full-body, brain-engaging workout.
