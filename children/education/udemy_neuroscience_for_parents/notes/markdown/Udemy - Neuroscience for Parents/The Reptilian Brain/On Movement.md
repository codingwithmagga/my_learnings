- The Misunderstood "Primitive" Brain
    - Not primitive, but primal: It’s the oldest part of the brain evolutionarily, but its functions are far from basic.
    - Critical roles: regulates heartbeat, breathing, body temperature, sleep, and movement coordination.
    - Without it, we couldn’t survive—it’s the foundation for all higher brain functions.
    - 
- Why Do We Even Have a Brain?
    - Surprising answer: The brain evolved primarily to coordinate movement, not for abstract thinking.
        - Plants don’t move (no brain); 
        - Even simple animals (like worms) developed nervous systems to wiggle.
    - Proof: The cerebellum ("small brain"):
        - Only 10% of brain volume but contains 50% of all neurons.
        - Controls balance, motor skills, and muscle coordination.
        - Evolved 400 million years ago (vs. humans’ 300,000-year existence).

- Movement is brain fuel for kids
    - Babies’ cerebellums grow rapidly in their first 3 months as they learn to move.
    - Modern problem: We force kids to sit still (school, TV) despite their brains being wired for constant motion.
        - Criticizing kids for fidgeting ignores biology—movement is natural and healthy.
    - Key insight: A sedentary lifestyle stifles brain development.

- Actionable Advice
    - Prioritize movement:
        - Outdoor play, sports, running—anything but prolonged sitting.
        - Limit screen time (more on this later).
    - Reframe expectations:
        - Restlessness isn’t disobedience; it’s the brain’s demand for activity.
        - Movement isn’t just for fitness—it’s essential for neural growth.
