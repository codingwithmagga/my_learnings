- Fundamentals
    - Commands & Parameters
        - What is the command line (cmd)?→A text interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. Some tools and commands are extremely useful and cannot be accessed otherwise.
        - 
        - `dir`::View every file and folder in the current folder.
        - 
        - What are parameters (also known as options or arguments)→Parameters are values passed to commands to modify their behavior.
        - 
        - `help <CMD>`::Displays the manual/help page of the `<CMD>`  
    - Navigating & Creating Directories
        - `cd`::Changing current directory 
        - `mkdir <DIR>`::Create directory `<DIR>` 
        - How to type names with spaces?→Enclose the name in double quotes, for example `mkdir "My Cats"`
        - `rmdir <DIR>`::Delete an empty directory `DIR`.
        - `rmdir /S <DIR>`::Delete a directory `DIR` and all its folders and files in it.
    - Moving, Renaming & Deleting
        - 
        - --------------------- Portal ---------------------
            - `move <FILE> <DIR>`::Move `<FILE>` to `<DIR>`, can also move directories 
        - `copy <FILE> <DIR>`::Copy `<FILE>` to `<DIR>`, can also copy directories
        - `ren <FILE/FOLDER> <NEW_NAME>`::Rename the file `<FILE>` or folder `<FOLDER>` to `<NEW_NAME>` 
        - `del <FILE>`::Deletes the file `<FILE>`, does not work on directories 
        - Explain Wildcards→Wildcards are special characters that represent one or more characters in a filename, allowing for flexible file manipulation. For example `*` to represent any number of any character. 
- Redirectors & Applications
    - Redirectors
        - Describe→A redirector is a special symbol that can be used to redirect the input or output from one command to another.

        - `type <FILE>`::Command used in a command line interface to display the contents of a specified file `<FILE>`.
        - `<CMD> >> <FILE>`::Append the output of `<CMD>` to an existing file `<FILE>` 
        - 
        - Combining commands
            - `&&`::Only runs the second command if the first runs succesfully. 
            - `&`::Always runs the second command.
            - `||`::Only runs the second command if the first one files.
            - `|`::Redirects the output of the first command as input to the second command. 
    - Starting Applications
        - Name three ways to start an application from the command line >>>
            - Internal commands - Launching programs that are built in the command line like `echo` 
            - Direct Invocation - Launching the program in the current directory and start by typing its name.
            - The start command - Initiating applications with the start command followed by the application name. This also works for programs that are located in paths from the `PATH` variable, like `start "" chrome.exe`. 
        - 
        - `Set <NAME>=<PATH_TO_EXE>`→Allows to start `<EXE>` using `start <NAME>`

            - How to add a function→Use the `:label` syntax to define a function and `goto label` to call it.
    - Loops
        - How to write a for loop in a batch script?→Use the `for` command with the `%%a` variable to iterate through items. `for %%a in ... DO (...)` 
    - Task Completion
        - How to get the extension of a file in a loop→Use a `for` loop and the `%%~x` variable in a batch script to extract and process file extensions.
