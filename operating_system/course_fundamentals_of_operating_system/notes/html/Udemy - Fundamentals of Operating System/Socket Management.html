                <li>Client-Server Architecture
                    <ul>
                        <li>Benefits?→Clients can call servers to perform expensive tasks which have the resources (like RAM, CPU etc.) to do it. Clients no longer require dependencies but can still execute lightweight tasks. This results in improved resource utilization.</li>
                        <li>What is RPC?→A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a technology that allows a computer program to execute a procedure (function) on another computer, as if it were a local procedure call.</li>
                        <li>What is absolutely necessary for this?→A network and a communication model.</li>

                        <li>Explain the three-way handshake→A three-way handshake is a method used in TCP/IP networks to establish a connection between two devices, involving a SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK exchange (in this order). <img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/o8vmPD2btd3KImkMciE9N-n5bv6izNBo_d52qiY6I22-xAChoKsz4rkyZ_7WWr6saaKxFTykm4z0szRuPyg96CLmoi9Nk6ZHmviX32y3vGYsIQw8eptxE_Kb243_jUvw.png" width="190" height="47.89693593314764"/></li>
                        <li>Explain how data is sent?→Data will be encapsulated in a segment and acknowledged (ACK) by the receiver. Data can be sent in multiple segments and acknowledged by a single response.

                        <li>Explain how a connection is closed?→A connection is closed when both the client and server send a FIN packet (started by one of them), followed by an ACK packet acknowledging the receipt of the FIN. It&#39;s a four way handshake.<img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/1Rrujy2vh4UoB_8hXBgqoKOMrmFCGisj0SCRt4qWRQ-8UhNY3fa5BPjSPN8JP9VIpPAThV4GVFlWAuzM5TxXVpFy0aynZE8xl1WqY7mBwOpV9HSX1ZUI0XgB57kPv-hY.png" width="708" height="182.4233983286908"/></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What is a socket?→A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs. It is created when a process listens on an IP/Port. </li>
                        <li>Relationship to the process?→The process owns the socket, which is stored in the PCB. It can be shared during a fork.</li>
                        <li>How is a connection established?
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kernel does the 3-way handshake and creates a socket and the SYN and accept queue</li>
                                <li>The backend process needs to &quot;accept&quot; the connection. Before that, it will be stored in the Accept Queue of the socket.</li>
                                <li>A connection file descriptor is created.</li>
                                <li>A send and a receive queue are created for outgoing and incoming data.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>What is socket sharding?→Socket sharding is a technique used to distribute network traffic across multiple sockets (or connections) to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance in network applications. </li>

        <li>Reading and Sending Data
            <ul>
                <li>What happens when data is received through a connection?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kernel puts data in receive queue</li>
                        <li>Kernel ACKs (may delay) and update window sizes</li>
                        <li>App calls read to copy data</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is the &quot;window size&quot; in the context of sockets?→The &quot;window size&quot; refers to the amount of data that can be sent before needing an acknowledgment from the receiver. The concept of window sizing is part of flow control. This helps prevent overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once. </li>

        <li>Socket Programming Patterns
            <ul>
                <li>There are multiple ways of implementing this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Single Listener / Single Worker thread (Node)</li>
                        <li>Single Listener / Multiple Worker threads (Memcached)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Listener and Acceptor in one main thread</li>
                                <li>Each connection gets its own reader thread</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Single Listener / Multiple Worker threads with load balancing (Ramcloud)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Building requests(jobs), each getting its own thread</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Multiple Acceptor Threads single Socket (nginx)
                            <ul>
                                <li>One Listener</li>
                                <li>Multiple Acceptors (fast accepting(user) possible) and readers </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Multiple Listeners on the same port (nginx and other)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Listener, Acceptor and reader in each thread</li>
                                <li>Using Socket sharding</li>
                                <li>Fastest way to accept as many connections as possible</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Asynchronous IO
            <ul>
                <li>Most IO operations are {{5164883595857813::blocking operations}} . This means the process cannot move their {{5164883595857813::program counter}} .</li>
                <li>Read blocks, for example when there is no data.

                    <ul>
                        <li>What does that lead to?→It leads to context switches and slowing down the process. Potentially blocked forever if data is never sent/received through that connection.</li>
                        <li>How to solve the blocking?→Ask OS if there is data. If so, call without blocking</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>With the function <q>select()</q> a collection of file descriptors will be monitored by the kernel and returns when any of is ready. Select is blocking but with a timeout. But the process needs to check which one is ready using a loop.

                        <li>Name Pros
                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid reading unready resources</li>
                                <li>async</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Name Cons
                            <ul>
                                <li>Slow, since we have to do the loop ⇒ <q>O(n)</q></li>
                                <li>Lots of copying to/from kernel/user space</li>
                                <li>Only supports a fixed size of file descriptors.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Better is <q>epoll</q>. Register an interest list of file descriptors in the kernel. Kernel updating this list. When the user calls <q>epoll__wait()</q>, the kernel returns a list of connections with data (events).

                </li>
                <li><q>io_uring</q> is a modern Linux asynchronous I/O (AIO) interface that uses two ring buffers (queues) for submission and completion events. The kernel and user space communicate via these queues, allowing zero-copy, low-latency I/O without <q>syscall</q> overhead for each operation. It supports file I/O, network I/O, and more, making it more flexible and efficient than <q>epoll </q>for high-performance workloads.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Biggest issue?→Security issues because of the usage of shared memory. Google even disabled <q>io_uring</q> in many applications because of this. </li>
