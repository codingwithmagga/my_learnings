      Improving CPU Performance

    <ul>
        <li>What is the purpose of separating a CPU into multiple units?
            <ul>
                <li>To enable pipelining, allowing simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. </li>
                <li>For example, the next instruction can be fetched, while the previous one is decoded. </li>
                <li>Without pipelining, the CPU or at least parts of the CPUs are (more) idle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Explain Hyper Threading and which problem is solves
            <ul>
                <li>Hyper Threading exposes a single core as multiple logical cores with dedicated registers, sharing  everything else (CU, ALU and L cache). </li>
                <li>It improves CPU utilization by allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously, reducing idle time.</li>
                <li>Overhead of context switch is reduced/removed, since the registers (which are normally replaced) are dedicated and the memory stays more or less the same.</li>
                <li>This was achieved by adding more registers to a CPU</li>
                <li>Hyper Threading does not work well, when the processes work on different data and the cache is invalidated anyway during a context switch</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Explain SIMD and how it improves the CPU performance
            <ul>
                <li>SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple Data</li>
                <li>With a single instruction, multiple values are added (or subtracted or...)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traditional: Add a1,b1; Add a2,b2; Add a3,b3; Add a4,b4</li>
                        <li>SIMD: Add [a1,a2,a3,a4], [b1,b2,b3,b4]</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This is like a vector operation with a fixed size, e.g. 32 bits</li>
                <li>It allows parallel processing of data, enhancing throughput and efficiency.</li>
                <li>E.g. ARM Neon architecture extension</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Speculative execution
            <ul>
                <li>What is speculative execution?→Speculative execution is a performance optimization where the CPU predicts the direction of branch instructions and executes subsequent instructions in advance.</li>
                <li>How does speculative execution improve performance?→It keeps the CPU busy during idle times, such as while waiting for memory operations to complete, saving time when predictions are correct.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
