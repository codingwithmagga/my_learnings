- Most IO operations are {{blocking operations}} . This means the process cannot move their {{program counter}} .
- Read blocks, for example when there is no data.

    - What does that lead to?→It leads to context switches and slowing down the process. Potentially blocked forever if data is never sent/received through that connection.
    - How to solve the blocking?→Ask OS if there is data. If so, call without blocking
- With the function `select()` a collection of file descriptors will be monitored by the kernel and returns when any of is ready. Select is blocking but with a timeout. But the process needs to check which one is ready using a loop.
    - Name Pros >>>
        - Avoid reading unready resources
        - async
    - Name Cons >>>
        - Slow, since we have to do the loop ⇒ `O(n)`
        - Lots of copying to/from kernel/user space
        - Only supports a fixed size of file descriptors.
- Better is `epoll`. Register an interest list of file descriptors in the kernel. Kernel updating this list. When the user calls `epoll__wait()`, the kernel returns a list of connections with data (events).

    - Drawbacks >>>
        - Complex, for example, missing events can be dangerous.
            - In edge tracking, additional user checks necessary
        - Only on linux
        - Too many `syscalls` 
        - Doesn't work on files, only on sockets and pipes
- `io_uring` is a modern Linux asynchronous I/O (AIO) interface that uses two ring buffers (queues) for submission and completion events. The kernel and user space communicate via these queues, allowing zero-copy, low-latency I/O without `syscall` overhead for each operation. It supports file I/O, network I/O, and more, making it more flexible and efficient than `epoll `for high-performance workloads.
    - Biggest issue?→Security issues because of the usage of shared memory. Google even disabled `io_uring` in many applications because of this.

- For cross-platform development use `lib_uv`.
