- There are multiple ways of implementing this:
    - Single Listener / Single Worker thread (Node)
    - Single Listener / Multiple Worker threads (Memcached)
        - Listener and Acceptor in one main thread
        - Each connection gets its own reader thread
    - Single Listener / Multiple Worker threads with load balancing (Ramcloud)
        - Building requests(jobs), each getting its own thread
    - Multiple Acceptor Threads single Socket (nginx)
        - One Listener
        - Multiple Acceptors (fast accepting(user) possible) and readers 
    - Multiple Listeners on the same port (nginx and other)
        - Listener, Acceptor and reader in each thread
        - Using Socket sharding
        - Fastest way to accept as many connections as possible
