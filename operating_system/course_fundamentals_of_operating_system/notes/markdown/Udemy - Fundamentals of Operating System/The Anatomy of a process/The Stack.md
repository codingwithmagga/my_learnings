- General
    - What is a stack in the context of functions?→A stack is a data structure where each function gets a frame in memory, and the active function is at the top of the stack.
    - How is the stack implemented in memory? >>>
        - The stack is implemented from high to low in memory, with the active function at the top.
        - Each function call pushes a new frame onto the stack, containing local variables and return addresses.

    - Why is stack space considered efficient?→Stack space is efficient because everything is stored sequentially, which is good for memory and CPU time, and it can be cached in one burst.
    - 
- Pointer
    - What is the instruction pointer/program counter?→The instruction pointer (or program counter) points to the next instruction in memory to be executed by the CPU.
    - What are the two pointers used in the stack?→The two pointers are the base pointer (at the start of the function stack) and the stack pointer (at the end of the function stack).
    - What is the stack pointer, and how does it work?→The stack pointer is stored in a specific register (sp) and moves as memory is allocated or deallocated, overwriting the previous data when needed.
    - What is the purpose of the base pointer in the process stack?→The base pointer is a static pointer that points to the beginning of the current function in the process stack, making it easier to address variables in the function.
- 
- Functions
    - What happens to the stack pointer in nested function calls?→The stack pointer moves, and the previous base pointer is stored so that it can be used to restore the base pointer after returning from the nested function.

    - What happens when a function returns?→The stack pointer is set to the base pointer, and the old base pointer is used to set the base pointer of the previous function ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/kGpgdhXsxkje67IdK1GeXbbMpUlep3zQNLAA3Uhe9J4b3JitMGfI5JOqRgYyDxuXrhIwSW2HXFPcVsLxnWJyhSvcqrqv5EvI_AFTA49ZgSAZvFsjMyHi4LgcMeuC1lMt.png)
    - What does the program counter (pc) do in nested function calls?→The program counter needs to be stored and set back to the correct point in the previous function after a nested function call.
    - How are function parameters and return values passed?→Function parameters and return values are passed through special registers.
- 
- Burst
    - What is burst mode in electronics?→Burst mode refers to transmitting data repeatedly without going through all the steps of each individual data transaction.
    - What is the main advantage of burst mode over single mode data access?→The main advantage of burst mode over single mode in data access is increased throughput and efficiency by transferring data in large chunks.
- 
- Issues
    - What causes a stack overflow?→A stack overflow occurs due to infinite function calls, recursion, or large local variables, potentially running out of stack space.
- 
- Performance
    - How are the member variables in a struct or class arranged in memory?→The member variables are stored in the order they are written in the definition of the struct or class.
    - How can rearranging member variables in a struct/class improve performance?→By grouping frequently used variables together, it improves memory access since they are loaded together in a cache line.
    - How did Google improve the performance of the TCP/IP stack in the Linux kernel?→Google improved the performance by 40% by rearranging the member variables in the struct to improve memory access efficiency.
