- RAM Types
    - Explain the main aspects of RAM >>>
        - Volatile memory, data is lost without power
        - Used for temporary storage of data and instructions
        - Faster than HDD/SDD
        - Dynamic and static types
    - Explain the main aspects of SRAM >>>
        - Static RAM
        - Faster access times compared to DRAM
        - Needs 6 transistors per bit ⇒ Expensive
        - Retains data without refresh cycles
        - Used in CPU caches
    - Explain the main aspects of DRAM >>>
        - Dynamic RAM
        - Uses capacitors (1 per bit) to store data, which needs 1 transistor each
        - Capacitors are either charged (1) or not (0)
        - Slower than SRAM, but denser and cheaper to produce
        - Requires periodic refreshing to maintain data integrity
        - Used in most computers and devices for main memory
    - Explain the refresh process of DRAM >>>
        - With time, capacitors lose their charge
        - Every few milliseconds, data (of one row of capacitors) is read to a sense amplifier
            - A sense amplifier detects small signals in electronic systems
        - The sense amplifier restores the charge to the capacitors to prevent data loss.
    - Explain the main aspects of Asynchronous RAM >>>
        - Operates independently of the system clock, allowing more flexibility in timing.
        - Typically, slower than synchronous RAM due to lack of clock synchronization.
        - There is a delay between requests and the responses:

    - Explain the main aspects of SDRAM >>>
        - Synchronous Dynamic RAM
        - RAM clock is synchronized with the system clock
        - Supports burst mode for faster data access
        - No wasted cycles

- DDR SDRAM
    - What does DDR SDRAM stand for?→Double Data Rate Synchronized Dynamic Random Access Memory
    - Explain the improvement in DDR SDRAM→Increased data transfer rates by transferring data on both rising and falling edges of the clock cycle.
    - Explain the main aspects of DDR4 SDRAM >>>
        - DDR4 Pins: Each pin transfers 1 byte (8 bits).
        - Burst Size: 64 bytes per memory access burst/cache line.
        - Cycle Time: Approximately 100 nanoseconds for reading.
        - Previous DDRs: DDR1 (2 bits), DDR2 (4 bits), DDR3 (8 bits).
        - Optimizations: DDR4 allows more transfers per second than DDR3 even if the number of bits are equal

    - Explain the improvements of DDR5 vs DDR4 >>>
        - Channels: DDR5 has two channels of 32 pins each.
        - Prefetch Buffer: Increased to 16 bits per pin.
        - Burst Size: Can deliver 128 bytes (two 64-byte bursts).
        - Channel Usage: Different cores can use separate channels.
        - Locking Mechanism: DDR4 locks during reads, blocking other cores.
        - CPU Requirement: Must support channel concept for efficiency.

- RAM Components
    - Explain the RAM structure >>>
        - Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM), where the RAM chips are build on
        - Bank: subdivision of memory within a RAM module
        - Rows: Multiple Rows in one Bank (for example 32k)
        - Columns: Multiple Columns per Row (for example 1024)
        - Cells: Multiple cells per column (usually 1cell = 1bit/capacitor and 16/32 cells per column)

    - Explain how the data is accessed in RAM >>>
        - Only one row can opened at a time
        - Because there is only one sense amplifier per bank
        - Opening a row means reading/draining the whole row
        - The relevant part of the row is cached in a burst

- Data alignement
    - Explain this image ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/X7bqpnSSx3xEgvYwn4iOrCf16JaESlm1Zeo4g4EJ78jXZ3G4YrxsQ-Bm05MjAS2s_34cnmY5kdUDDc-6VD6FQmSiG4JwAnFoFFOvRhfDK7EyXG2vQ1WiMNrzTXL1jIPr.png) >>>
        - Data alignement concept
        - Certain variable sizes are stored in specific addresses
        - E.g. 4 bytes are placed in addresses divisible by 4
        - Rearranging the data can reduce the necessary memory space
