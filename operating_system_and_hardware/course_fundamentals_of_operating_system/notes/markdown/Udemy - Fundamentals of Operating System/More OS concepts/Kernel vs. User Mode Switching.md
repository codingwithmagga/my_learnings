- Kernel vs. User
    - In the process memory space, there is an additional part at the top of each process. What is it?→It's the kernel stack space.
    - The CPU has two modes.→User and Kernel mode
    - What is done in CPU user mode?→The code of the user is executed
    - What is done in Kernel Mode?→The code from the kernel (in the kernel stack) is executed like system calls, drivers etc. 
    - How are the access rights for kernel and user mode in the process memory space for kernel and user space?→In kernel mode, both spaces can be accessed, while in user mode only the user space can be accessed.
    - Describe what happens when the process switch to kernel mode→Almost the same as in a context switch between threads of the same process and when a function is called. The base pointer is stored on the kernel stack, as well as the return address. All registers values and states are stored in memory. 
    - What cost comes with a kernel switch? >>>
        - Mode switch (store all registers and restore them)
        - Memory access
        - Security check and validation
        - System call number lookup (lookup for kernel function place)
