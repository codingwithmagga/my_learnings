- Bound Workload
    - Explain CPU Bound Workload→A CPU-bound workload is one that spends most of its time performing computations on the CPU. For example, encryption, Compression, sorting, ...
    - Explain IO Bound Workload→A workload where the process spends more time waiting for I/O operations than performing computations. For example, database queries, network connection write/read, file read/write, ...

- Multithreaded vs. Multi-process
    - Multi-process
        - Spins up multiple process
        - Isolated from each other
        - e.g. NGINX, Postgres
    - Multithreaded
        - Parent process spins multiple threads
        - Shares memory with the parent
        - e.g. MySQL, libuv

- Mutex
    - Explains concurrency issues with shared memory, like a race condition with two threads. It can be solved using a mutex. The mutex lives in the same shared space and the OS only allows one holding it.
    - Book: Unix Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Caching for Kernel Programmers
    - Mutex has ownership
    - The thread that locks Mutex must unlock
    - If a thread terminates, the mutex can remain locked
    - Can cause deadlock
- 
- Semaphores
    - Semaphores can be used for mutual exclusion
    - In general, this is a number with signals that can increment/decrement the value (atomically)
    - Wait/blocks when semaphore=0
    - Any thread with access to the semaphore can signal/wait
