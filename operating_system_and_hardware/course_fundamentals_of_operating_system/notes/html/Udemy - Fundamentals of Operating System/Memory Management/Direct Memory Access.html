      Direct Memory Access 
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>What happens when a key is pressed on the keyboard?→When a key is pressed, the value is written to the keyboard buffer and the CPU is interrupted. The interruption is a context switch to kernel mode, which executes the interrupt service routine (ISR) function in the kernel.</li>
        <li>What does the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) function do for keyboard inputs?→The ISR function reads from the keyboard, puts the value in the CPU cache, and then transfers it to the memory.</li>
        <li>Why is DMA useful for larger amounts of data?→Otherwise, the transfer of every single data point goes through the CPU, which causes a bottleneck for larger amounts of data.</li>
        <li>What is the DMA and what does it do?
            <ul>
                <li>DMA stands for Direct Memory Access.</li>
                <li>It allows direct access from the network/disk to the RAM.</li>
                <li>The CPU initializes the transfer with a memory address for reading/writing and the device buffer.</li>
                <li>The DMA executes the operation and starts the direct transfer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Why is it important that the address is locked during DMA operations?→It is important because the DMA uses a physical address for the transfer, and the address must be locked to prevent any other operations from interfering with the ongoing transfer.</li>
        <li>What are some drawbacks associated with DMA?
            <ul>
                <li>DMA can be susceptible to DMA attacks (security issue).</li>
                <li>It adds complexity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Is it a good idea to use the DMA for keyboard and mouse interrupts? Why or why not?→No, DMA shouldn&#39;t be used for keyboard and mouse interrupts because the CPU is faster in handling these due to the initialization costs involved with DMA.</li>
