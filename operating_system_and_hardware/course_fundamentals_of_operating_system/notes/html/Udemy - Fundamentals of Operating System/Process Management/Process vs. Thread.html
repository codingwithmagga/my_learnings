    <ul>
        <li>Process Control Block (PCB)
            <ul>
                <li>Define→The PCB is a data structure in the kernel memory space where process metadata (like the program counter, PID, and memory data) is stored.</li>
                <li>What does it contain?
                    <ul>
                        <li>PID, Process State, Program counter, registers</li>
                        <li>Process Control info (running/stopped, priority)</li>
                        <li>Page Table </li>
                        <li>Accounting (CPU/Memory usage)</li>
                        <li>Memory Management info (Pointer to code/stack etc.)</li>
                        <li>I/O info (File descriptors, e.g. in Linux everything is a file like sockets, outgoing connections ...)</li>
                        <li>IPC (interprocess communication) info, semaphores, mutexes, shared memory, messages</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Kernel Process Table
            <ul>
                <li>Purpose→Keeps track of all currently running processes in the system in a table mapping PID to PCB location. Located in the kernel memory space.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Threads
            <ul>
                <li>Explain why a thread is a lighter weight process→Threads share the same memory space and resources as their parent process, requiring less overhead to create and manage.</li>
                <li>What is shared between different threads in the same process?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory space, including code, data, and heap. </li>
                        <li>File descriptors </li>
                        <li>Interprocess communication entities like mutexes or semaphores.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is unique for each thread?→Each thread has its own program counter, register(s) (values), and stack.</li>
                <li>Explain the memory structure of a process in RAM with threads
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/C-slemGNUxZxIzlacwlNWo5zWtdzo-j7R0JZjjDvnEalnXklGUBAsuafYpUeExjK3zoYXT8Rd9ktLpNu-o9llU3LccarW76o6SrqC1MiBzqJgZ3K1bvPbI4zdVLeUOuv.png" width="479" height="605"/></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Explain the benefit of sharing the PCB between threads→Reduces overhead when switching between the threads. For example, the TLB doesn&#39;t have to be flushed, since they share the same page tables.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Thread Control Block (TCB)
            <ul>
                <li>Define→The TCB is a data structure in the kernel memory space where thread metadata (like TID, program counter, registers) is stored.</li>
                <li>What does it contain?
                    <ul>
                        <li>TID, Thread State, Program counter, registers</li>
                        <li>Process Control info (running/stopped, priority)</li>
                        <li>Accounting (CPU/Memory usage)</li>
                        <li>Memory Management info (Pointer to code/stack etc.)</li>
                        <li>Pointer to parent PCB</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Which metadata is shared with the parent process?→Page Table, IO info (file descriptors) and IPC info (semaphores, shared memory etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Kernel Thread Table
            <ul>
                <li>Purpose→Keeps track of all currently running threads in the system in a table mapping TID to TCB location.  Located in the kernel memory space.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Fork of a process
            <ul>
                <li>Define→A fork creates a nearly identical copy of a process. </li>
                <li>What is Copy on Write (CoW)?→Copy-on-write is a memory management technique that delays copying data until it is modified. Before that, the memory is shared, for example between two processes.</li>
                <li>What happens with the memory during a fork?→The child process must have new virtual memory space. But the OS uses CoW, so pages can be shared unless a write operation happens, for example calling a function.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Example Postgres
            <ul>
                <li>In Postgres, every database connection creates a new (forked) process. Which is a bad idea because it creates so much overhead compared to a thread. They needed to limit the number of connections to 100 because of this. </li>
                <li>It is often solved by having a pool of connections and multiple users share these connections. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
