            <ul>
                <li>What is a socket?→A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs. It is created when a process listens on an IP/Port. </li>
                <li>Relationship to the process?→The process owns the socket, which is stored in the PCB. It can be shared during a fork.</li>
                <li>How is a connection established?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kernel does the 3-way handshake and creates a socket and the SYN and accept queue</li>
                        <li>The backend process needs to &quot;accept&quot; the connection. Before that, it will be stored in the Accept Queue of the socket.</li>
                        <li>A connection file descriptor is created.</li>
                        <li>A send and a receive queue are created for outgoing and incoming data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is socket sharding?→Socket sharding is a technique used to distribute network traffic across multiple sockets (or connections) to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance in network applications. </li>
