        <li>Assembly Language and Machine Code
            <ul>
                <li>What is assembly language?→Assembly is the closest you can get to universal instructions that can be used on almost every machine. But it&#39;s still sometimes CPU specific.</li>
                <li>What is the difference between assembly and machine code?→Assembly and machine code are similar but different; assembly is more readable and can be mapped to machine code, which is binary and not human-readable.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>CPU Execution and Performance
            <ul>
                <li>Can two processes run on the same core simultaneously?→No, two processes cannot run at the same time on the same core, except in cases like hyper-threading or using multiple virtual cores.</li>
                <li>How much space does each instruction occupy in memory?→Each instruction occupies 4 bytes (32-bit machine) or 8 bytes (64-bit machine).</li>
