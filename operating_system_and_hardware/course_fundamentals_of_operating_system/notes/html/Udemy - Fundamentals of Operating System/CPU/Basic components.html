        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li>What is the ALU?→Short for arithmetic logical unit and part of the CPU. The basic unit that actually does the computation in the CPU. These are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, which are basically done using logic like AND, OR and XOR.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>What is the CU?→Short for control unit and part of the CPU. Controls/Manages the execution, fetching and decoding of instructions in the CPU. The execution of an instruction does not always include the ALU, for example just a memory access or fetching data from a register.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>What are the main characteristics and types of registers?
            <ul>
                <li>Registers provide very fast data access (1-2 ns).</li>
                <li>They are small memory units (32 or 64 bits).</li>
                <li>They are expensive to build.</li>
                <li>Examples include program counters, instruction registers, stack pointers, and base pointers.</li>

                <li>Reads from memory and uses caches.</li>
                <li>Translates virtual to physical addresses.</li>
                <li>Contains the TLB, which caches the translation table.</li>
                <li>Requires flushing during context switches.</li>
                <li>Manages memory protection and access control</li>
                <li>Handles memory paging (fixed-size blocks) and segmentation (variable-size blocks)</li>
                <li>Swapping: Moves data between RAM and disk storage to free up memory for active processes, essential in systems with limited physical memory.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>L1 cache is the fastest, smallest cache closest to the CPU, followed by L2 and then L3, each progressively larger and slower. </li>
                        <li>L1 local to Core, separated in a data and instruction cache.
                            <ul>
                                <li>○ CU can fetch data and instructions at the same time</li>
                                <li>○ 1 ns</li>

                <li>Why should cache invalidation be avoided?→Cache invalidation can cause performance bottlenecks due to the time-consuming process of updating all cached data. Accessing data from memory is time consuming.</li>
                <li>What is the purpose of caches?→Caches store frequently accessed data closer to the CPU, reducing access time. Reduced Latency: Decreases the time it takes for applications to retrieve data, enhancing performance.</li>
