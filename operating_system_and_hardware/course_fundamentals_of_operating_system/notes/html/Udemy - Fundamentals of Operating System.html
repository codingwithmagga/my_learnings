    <ul>
        <li>Why an OS?
            <ul>
                <li>Why do we need an Operating System?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why do we need an Operating System?→We don&#39;t need an operating system per se, but it is easier to deal with hardware and resources using an abstracted layer, which is the operating system. An OS, which is a piece of software, manages diverse hardware, including varying RAM, CPU architectures, storage devices, and input peripherals, reducing complexity for developers.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>What would be challenges without an OS?
                            <ul>
                                <li>If building an application on a specific hardware setup, developers would be forced to handle each hardware component&#39;s interactions directly.</li>
                                <li>This process can lead to complexity, increased chances of errors, and performance degradation as all device-specific code must be managed manually.</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>General-purpose operating systems (which are most OS) like Linux are designed to work across a wide range of devices and use cases, making them invaluable for most applications. However, they often come with overhead due to their need to accommodate many different scenarios, which can affect performance. While specialized systems can be more efficient for specific tasks, they limit the application to the hardware for which they were designed. Examples include companies like Apple, which design their systems (e.g., M1 chip) to optimize performance by tightly controlling hardware integration. Developing an app on a lightweight OS or directly on hardware means it may only run on that particular setup, limiting versatility and portability. The existence of a robust OS allows developers to create applications that can function across various platforms. Operating systems play a crucial role in application development by providing necessary abstractions and management tools, enabling developers to focus on building functionality rather than managing hardware details.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>The application you write &quot;talks&quot; to the OS and the OS translates your request for the devices. It is the biggest abstraction layer. Abstraction hides complexity, but this has also limitations. The application never talks to the hardware directly.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>Scheduling and processes
                            <ul>
                                <li>The OS handles scheduling processes to ensure fair resource distribution among competing tasks. Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to allocate CPU time effectively, preventing any single process from monopolizing system resources. For example, Windows 3.1 was awful at this and let run a task really long/forever. Memory and I/O needs also to be distributed. One of the most challenging things an OS needs to do.</li>

                        <li>Example to improve OS
                            <ul>
                                <li>Google waited for every SSD to shut down individually, doing a synchronous shutdown. Because of huge numbers of SSDs in their servers, it took over a minute for a reboot. They made it asynchronous, and it took less than a second to shut down the server.</li>

                <li>System Architecture Overview
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every system has limited resources (like CPU/memory) which needs to be managed. This is usually done by the kernel. The OS has more tools for usability, for example a GUI.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>Kernel
                            <ul>
                                <li>The core part of the OS is the kernel. The kernel manages mostly everything, knows how to deal with drivers, how to read/write memory, schedule processes, the CPU etc. Users may not interact directly with the kernel but depend on its functionality through system APIs. The kernel manages processes, ensuring fair resource allocation and scheduling tasks effectively to maximize performance. Early OS versions faced challenges with blocking processes, prompting improvements in scheduling techniques.</li>
                                <li>The OS is more than the kernel. There are many tools (GUI, command lines, …) on top of the kernel. The kernel exposes an API for the OS, for example to extract all current processes. The distributions (Linux, Windows, Mac) are all about these extra tooling.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>CPU (Central Processing Unit)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Components of Each CPU Core:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>1. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ Responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. It executes calculations and decision-making processes within the CPU.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>2. CU (Control Unit):
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ Manages the execution of instructions by directing the operation of the ALU, memory, and input/output devices. The CU fetches instructions from memory and decodes them to control execution.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>3. Registers:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold temporary data, such as operands for operations and intermediate results. Registers provide quick access to data during instruction execution.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>4. MMU (Memory Management Unit):
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ Responsible for translating virtual memory addresses to physical addresses. It helps manage memory access and protection, allowing multiple processes to operate securely in memory.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>5. L1 Cache:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ The first level of cache memory, located closest to the core. It stores copies of frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up access times.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>6. L2 Cache:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ The second level of cache, larger than L1 but slower. It serves as an additional buffer to store data before it is fetched from main memory.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>7. L3 Cache:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>○ Shared between the cores and larger than both L1 and L2 caches, the L3 cache helps improve data access speed for both cores, reducing the need to access the slower main memory.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/_O7nuXeqng0MCa6ZXaJY4KrB2GJmbKkaDxEL27_PR3ayXu_deVuwCirGfQgiI4_yl0x1EpW57nDj2UNER5i-RfFjkHS31rjZQeVXGcZ6G09MQadU_TvXYjRW6XLk8Vt1.png" width="648" height="391"/></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>In the CPU, the actual execution (of machine level instructions in ALU) happens. Another word is processor, which means the whole socket, which can have multiple CPU cores (Dual, Quad etc.). In the above image there are two cores, so is a dual-core. Each core has a specific clock speed (mostly one). Complex instructions can need more cycles (and more time/power).</li>
                                <li>Values which are used frequently should be close to the CPU. That&#39;s why we have L1-L2-L3 cache. The L3 cache is often shared between all cores. Discarding cash is slow, needs to be avoided!</li>
                                <li>Each CPU machine code is different. When compiling Code, like C/C++, you need to specify what CPU you are compiling against. That&#39;s one of the limitations of compiled languages. Different CPU architectures (e.g., x86, x64, ARM) have distinct instruction sets. Each machine code instruction is specific to the architecture it was compiled for. When you compile C or C++ code, you typically specify the target architecture for which you want the executable to be built. This ensures that the generated machine code is compatible with the intended CPU. If two CPUs are based on the same architecture (e.g., both are x86 or both are x64), the compiled executable can run on any machine with that architecture regardless of specific CPU models. For instance, an executable compiled for x64 architecture can run on any x64 compatible CPU (like Intel or AMD processors). Compiled programs can rely on an operating system that abstracts some hardware-specific features. For example, on Windows, the OS provides a layer that allows applications to interact with the hardware without needing to know specifics about the underlying CPU. In other languages like python or Java, someone actually did this compilation for you, for example python.exe.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>Memory (RAM, Random Access Memory)
                            <ul>
                                <li>&quot;Random&quot; because you don&#39;t have access to it sequentially, like in a hardware disk (SSDs are technically random access memory). It is slower than cache, but way faster than a hard drive. Storage is limited, less than hard drive, more than cache. It is volatile, so the moment no power is available, every information is lost. RAM always immediately writes changes (and only the changes) to the disk sequentially.  It&#39;s stores process states and data. When spinning a process, it lives in memory. It&#39;s basically a bunch of data structures of memory with their machine code. The program tells the CPU to fetch data from the RAM and executes the process. The program that runs the processes exists on the disk.</li>
                                <li>The OS manages the usage of the RAM. Physical memory is limited, so there is virtual memory. Virtual memory hides the physical layout from you, it is an abstraction from the OS. You think it&#39;s there and calling the virtual address, but the OS will maybe pull it again because it was deleted meanwhile.</li>

                        <li></li>
                        <li>Storage (SSD, HDD)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Persistent storage even with no power. Two types: hard disk drive and solid-state drive. Using the NAND technology.</li>
                                <li>In an HDD, you can write a small sector, but in SSD, you need to write a whole page and need to find an empty, ready-to-use page. When you update a file in a SSD you take the value of it, invalidate the result, read the data and move it to a new page. SSD has to take invalid pages and make them available again, which is an overhead in a SSD. The kernel has drivers which know how to write to an HDD/SSD (moving the needles and so on). SSD have a controller/driver inside, while for the old SSDs the controller lived in the memory of the host.  NVMe (Nonvolatile Memory Express) is a software protocol for SSD to connect them over a physical interface without manufacturer drivers. The operating system knows with this how to talk to the SSDs.</li>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Network
                            <ul>
                                <li>The network card has also controller (NIC, network interface controller) which receives commands from the OS. Data (for example from the internet) is processed locally on the network card. The OS can talk to other hosts through the network. Signals from the cable (electric Ethernet, fiber lights) gets converted to bits, which are converted to layer two frames, and then layer three packets and layer four segments. Layer three and four are dealt by the OS. TCP (Transmission Control protocol) may be the oldest network protocol from 1981 and is implemented in the OS for efficiency reasons.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>File System
                            <ul>
                                <li>Storage is mostly blocks of bytes. We look at the storage as an array of blocks. But earlier it looked like a cylinder, because of the shape of the hard drive, and it was physically implemented like this in the kernel. Now we can&#39;t get away from it. Now the vendors couldn&#39;t evolve their products. So they invented a mapping between number of blocks vs. place on storage ⇒ logical block addressing (LBA).</li>
                                <li>Users like to work with files and directories, which are essentially an abstraction of the block like storage. So the file system is an abstraction for the user. Including its own data structure, nodes, headers, metadata, file names, mutexes to build files and so on. Files are stored on the disk as blocks. A file can only be stored in a whole number of blocks, so when it&#39;s too small, part of a block is wasted. How the files are exactly stored depends on the filesystem (ext4, fat32, NTFS). The OS needs to know the filesystem to read the data, it can&#39;t be read using another filesystem.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li></li>
                        <li>Program vs. Process
                            <ul>
                                <li>A program is a compiled executable, a process is an instance of the program. A program can be executed multiple times and creates a new process each time. The program lives in the disk, while the processes live in memory.  The process is a program in motion. Different OSs have different executable formats.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>Process management
                            <ul>
                                <li>The kernel manages the processes and schedules the process for the CPU and also schedules the threads. A process has at least one but can create multiple threads. The OS can interrupt process/threads and give CPU time to another one. Also, storage, I/O etc. is managed by the kernel for each process/thread.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/5aD4kWQ6xZlW27-qD50rFqP3DNsvJqVecjXjWuE8U5RqOlzpkg8VyIHqb1ElQqHflmZxEKHrDDCBGw7_RHTnm_XO1OliwYd9BwMvUA1kMt2q-5XufgB2WR78Z1Kk2NVo.png" width="433" height="549"/></li>

                                <li>On the left, virtual memory addresses. Part is for the user and a part for the kernel. This just shows the maximum as it&#39;s virtual and mapped to the physical address. It is not necessarily everything allocated memory. The protected kernel space is to access the kernel functionality and, if necessary (system call for example, see below) the process switches to a kernel mode. The kernel does not have its own running process which is switched on and off, it lies in the same (user) process. The kernel space, for example, contains the kernel code, device drivers, TCP/IP stack. In kernel space the virtual memory is one to one mapped to the physical memory, this is not the case for the user space. Normally, the two spaces are isolated, but the rule was broken, and the kernel space has now a shared memory where the user can write into. With this, there is a really efficient and fast option for I/O stuff. Because data from I/O needs otherwise copied from kernel to user space. Including back and forth switches to kernel mode.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li></li>
                        <li>System call

                                <li>Jumps/Switches from user to kernel mode. The user can make a system call, for example, to allocate memory. Like in C <q>read()</q>, <q>write()</q>, <q>malloc()</q>. Mode switching is expensive since the registers, memory etc. needs to be saved and restored in the CPU. Best to limit this. </li>

                                <li>Device drivers are the software in the kernel which manages the hardware devices, for example keyboard, network driver and so on. The driver knows how to talk to the hardware. This is done by the interrupt service routine (ISR). For example, a key is pressed on the keyboard, the ISR immediately interrupts the CPU and executes certain code for this key press.</li>

                                <li>What is a Process ID (PID)?→A PID is a unique identifier assigned to each process, along with other data structures like the page table and file descriptors.</li>
                                <li>What is a PID namespace?→A PID namespace gives processes an independent set of PIDs, and it can be nested, allowing processes to have unique PIDs within different namespaces.</li>
                                <li>What happens during a context switch with the process data (new/old)?→During a context switch, the process&#39;s current state, including the program counter, is saved to memory, and the state of another process is loaded.</li>

                                <li>What is the instruction pointer/program counter?→The instruction pointer (or program counter) points to the next instruction in memory to be executed by the CPU.</li>
                                <li>What are the two pointers used in the stack?→The two pointers are the base pointer (at the start of the function stack) and the stack pointer (at the end of the function stack).</li>
                                <li>What is the stack pointer, and how does it work?→The stack pointer is stored in a specific register (sp) and moves as memory is allocated or deallocated, overwriting the previous data when needed.</li>
                                <li>What is the purpose of the base pointer in the process stack?→The base pointer is a static pointer that points to the beginning of the current function in the process stack, making it easier to address variables in the function.</li>

                                <li>What happens when a function returns?→The stack pointer is set to the base pointer, and the old base pointer is used to set the base pointer of the previous function <img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/kGpgdhXsxkje67IdK1GeXbbMpUlep3zQNLAA3Uhe9J4b3JitMGfI5JOqRgYyDxuXrhIwSW2HXFPcVsLxnWJyhSvcqrqv5EvI_AFTA49ZgSAZvFsjMyHi4LgcMeuC1lMt.png" width="542" height="513"/></li>
                                <li>What does the program counter (pc) do in nested function calls?→The program counter needs to be stored and set back to the correct point in the previous function after a nested function call.</li>
                                <li>How are function parameters and return values passed?→Function parameters and return values are passed through special registers.</li>

                        <li>Is the size of the data section fixed?→The data section has a fixed size.</li>
                        <li>Which functions have access to the data section of a process?→The data section is shared by all functions of the process. In other words: Each function can access the data section.</li>
                        <li>How does the compiler determine the size of the data section?→The compiler knows how much space is needed for the data section after compilation, and this can be estimated through static analysis of the code.</li>
                        <li>Is the data section read-only?→No, the data section is not read-only, but it has a fixed size (for example, an integer variable remains an integer variable).</li>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the pointer at the start of the data section?→The pointer at the start of the data section, similar to the base pointer, helps address variables with the offset.</li>
                        <li>What can happen when a global variable is changed when using multiple threads?→When using multiple threads in one process, changing a global variable can cause cache invalidation more often, which decreases performance.</li>

                                        <li>External fragmentation occurs when free memory is split into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate larger memory requests.</li>

                                <li>Cause→It arises from allocating and deallocating memory dynamically. Over time, as processes are loaded and removed, gaps of free space form between allocated blocks.</li>
                                <li>Impact→Reduces available memory and increases the likelihood of needing to swap pages to disk.</li>

                                <li>Cause→Internal fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks, and the amount of memory requested by a process is less than the size of the allocated block. The unused space within the allocated block is wasted and cannot be used by other processes, leading to inefficient memory utilization. </li>

                                <li>The logical page is mapped to the physical page using a process page table</li>
                                <li>Many to one mapping, which means many virtual pages can map to one physical address</li>

                        <li>Explain how shared memory works in virtual memory
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shared memory allows multiple processes to access and modify the same region of virtual memory, since all virtual addresses are mapped the same physical address space</li>
                                <li>E.g. spinning up the same program multiple times, the code is just loaded once to memory and all virtual pages map to the same physical space</li>
                                <li>The same works for shared libraries, they are only loaded once to the RAM.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Explain how data isolation works in virtual memory→Each process has its own isolated address space, preventing one process from accessing another&#39;s memory.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The OS can decide to store process memory which was not used for some time on to disk. </li>
                                <li>The space in RAM is freed and can be used by other or even the same process. </li>
                                <li>When the stored data is accessed again via its virtual address, the OS copies the process data back to RAM. </li>

                                <li>Each process has its own page table</li>
                                <li>The page table is stored in memory, adding an overhead for address translation.</li>
                                <li>Accessing the page table requires additional memory reads, impacting performance</li>
                                <li>The overhead can be reduced by the TLB</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Describe what the TLB does→Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB): A cache that stores recently used virtual-physical mappings to speed up address resolution.</li>
                        <li>What is a drawback of virtual memory?

                                <li>We have an additional layer of translations, since the CPU can&#39;t read from virtual addresses.</li>
                                <li>This is done by page tables, but adding this includes additional maintenance and memory usage</li>
                                <li>If a page fault occurs, the performance sinks due to kernel mode switch and reading/writing back from disc.</li>
                                <li>All this results in a more complex CPU architectures (MMU/TLB)</li>

                <li>Direct Memory Access 
                    <ul>
                        <li>What happens when a key is pressed on the keyboard?→When a key is pressed, the value is written to the keyboard buffer and the CPU is interrupted. The interruption is a context switch to kernel mode, which executes the interrupt service routine (ISR) function in the kernel.</li>
                        <li>What does the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) function do for keyboard inputs?→The ISR function reads from the keyboard, puts the value in the CPU cache, and then transfers it to the memory.</li>
                        <li>Why is DMA useful for larger amounts of data?→Otherwise, the transfer of every single data point goes through the CPU, which causes a bottleneck for larger amounts of data.</li>
                        <li>What is the DMA and what does it do?
                            <ul>
                                <li>DMA stands for Direct Memory Access.</li>
                                <li>It allows direct access from the network/disk to the RAM.</li>
                                <li>The CPU initializes the transfer with a memory address for reading/writing and the device buffer.</li>
                                <li>The DMA executes the operation and starts the direct transfer.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Why is it important that the address is locked during DMA operations?→It is important because the DMA uses a physical address for the transfer, and the address must be locked to prevent any other operations from interfering with the ongoing transfer.</li>
                        <li>What are some drawbacks associated with DMA?
                            <ul>
                                <li>DMA can be susceptible to DMA attacks (security issue).</li>
                                <li>It adds complexity.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Is it a good idea to use the DMA for keyboard and mouse interrupts? Why or why not?→No, DMA shouldn&#39;t be used for keyboard and mouse interrupts because the CPU is faster in handling these due to the initialization costs involved with DMA.</li>

                                <li>To enable pipelining, allowing simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. </li>
                                <li>For example, the next instruction can be fetched, while the previous one is decoded. </li>
                                <li>Without pipelining, the CPU or at least parts of the CPUs are (more) idle.</li>

                                <li>Hyper Threading exposes a single core as multiple logical cores with dedicated registers, sharing  everything else (CU, ALU and L cache). </li>
                                <li>It improves CPU utilization by allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously, reducing idle time.</li>
                                <li>Overhead of context switch is reduced/removed, since the registers (which are normally replaced) are dedicated and the memory stays more or less the same.</li>
                                <li>This was achieved by adding more registers to a CPU</li>
                                <li>Hyper Threading does not work well, when the processes work on different data and the cache is invalidated anyway during a context switch</li>

                                <li>What is speculative execution?→Speculative execution is a performance optimization where the CPU predicts the direction of branch instructions and executes subsequent instructions in advance.</li>
                                <li>How does speculative execution improve performance?→It keeps the CPU busy during idle times, such as while waiting for memory operations to complete, saving time when predictions are correct.</li>

                                <li>In Postgres, every database connection creates a new (forked) process. Which is a bad idea because it creates so much overhead compared to a thread. They needed to limit the number of connections to 100 because of this. </li>

                        <li>What is a context?→A process or thread is a context, which can be switched.</li>
                        <li>What happens during a context switch?→The operating system saves the state (registers) of one process to the corresponding PCB and loads the state of another. </li>
                        <li>When is the TLB flushed?→During a context switch involving processes. Threads of the same process use the same paging table and can use the &quot;old&quot; TLB values.</li>
                        <li>Explain TLB ASID in short→TLB ASID (Address space ID) is a unique identifier that allows multiple processes to share the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) without interfering with each other&#39;s address translations. This can avoid TLB flushing on context switch.</li>
                        <li>Context switch can be done by scheduling algorithms or preemptive multitasking (a process is not allowed to run for too long).</li>

                                <li>Why was introducing new HDD layouts a hard and painful task and how was it solved?→In the early stages, where was no HDD controller and the OS was sending commands directly to the hard drive. The layout of the HDD (CHS) was exposed to the OS. The OS didn&#39;t work on other layouts. It was solved by adding an HDD controller which does the conversion from CHS to the new layout.</li>

                                        <li>Define→Logical Block Addressing is a method of addressing data on a hard disk drive. Only one number is used to address data, and each linear base address describes a single block. Also used in SSD. Also known as logical sector size.</li>
                                        <li>What problem does it solve?→Logical Block Addressing (LBA) solves the problem of needing a consistent way to address data on a hard disk drive (HDD) regardless of its physical layout.</li>
                                        <li>Drawback?→Additional cost for the translation of the LBA number to the disk address, which is done by the disk controller.</li>

                                <li>Structure→SSDs use flash memory organized in blocks and pages for persistent storage. A block is a collection of pages which have a fixed size (4kb, 16kb, ...)</li>
                                <li>What is flash memory?→Non-volatile memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. There is NOR flash and NAND flash. SSD uses NAND flash.</li>
                                <li>Minimum read, write and erase size?→The minimum read and write size is a page. Erase is a whole block because it is expensive.</li>
                                <li>Flash translation layer::Software layer that manages the mapping of logical block addresses to physical storage locations in flash memory devices.</li>
                                <li>Why is LBA mapping more expensive than in HDD→More complex mapping since it has to be updated continuously because there is no &quot;update&quot; functionality in an SSD. The mapping table is stored in a RAM (mostly DRAM) belonging to the SSD.</li>
                                <li>What is Write amplification?→Write amplification is the phenomenon where writing data to a storage device requires writing a larger amount of data than the original data size. Because flash memory must be erased before it can be rewritten, the process to perform a write operation results in moving (or rewriting) user data and metadata more than once.</li>

                                        <li>Explain→Wear leveling is a technique used in SSDs to distribute write operations evenly across all memory blocks, extending the lifespan of the drive. Because NAND cells have a write limit.</li>
                                        <li>Why is it necessary?→Extending the lifespan. Without this, there are pages which are never touched (like OS files or shared libraries) called cold pages and hot pages which are updated all the time. So some pages will die way before others.</li>

                                        <li>FAT32 is a file system that organizes files and directories on a storage device using a File Allocation Table.  </li>
                                        <li>The basic idea is an array of 32bit integers, where the index is the LBA. The value in the array itself at this index is the next index until we reach the end.</li>
                                        <li>Reading all the LBAs in order gives the file.</li>

                                <li>Why can only be 28 bits used for the LBA index instead of 32?→Four bits are reserved for other purposes like &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;free&quot;, leaving only 28 bits for the LBA index.</li>
                                <li>Explain the issue with low LBA sizes and how it was solved?→In the old standard (LBA=512 byte), you could only address 2^28*512 bytes ~ 128GB. It was solved using Clustering.</li>
                                <li>Clustering
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Explain→Cluster is a logical grouping of LBAs. For example, 8LBAS = 1 cluster (4kb, if LBA = 512byte). So Block/Cluster 0 ⇒ LBAs 0-7, Block/Cluster 1 ⇒LBAs 8-15 and so on. Now you can address 8*128GB ~ 1 TB.</li>
                                        <li>A larger cluster size allows more disk space to be addressed. But what is the disadvantage here?→Larger <a isRemReference="true" href="Udemy%20-%20Fundamentals%20of%20Operating%20System/Storage%20Management/Persistent%20storage/HDD/Parts/Cluster.html?isPin=false">Cluster</a> sizes lead to wasted space for smaller files (<a isRemReference="true" href="Udemy%20-%20Fundamentals%20of%20Operating%20System/Memory%20Management/Virtual%20memory/Internal%20fragmentation.html?isPin=false">Internal fragmentation</a>).</li>

Since everything on Linux is treated as a file, the same API can be used to read/write a socket connection.</li>

                                <li>Benefits?→Clients can call servers to perform expensive tasks which have the resources (like RAM, CPU etc.) to do it. Clients no longer require dependencies but can still execute lightweight tasks. This results in improved resource utilization.</li>
                                <li>What is RPC?→A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a technology that allows a computer program to execute a procedure (function) on another computer, as if it were a local procedure call.</li>

                                <li>What is a socket?→A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs. It is created when a process listens on an IP/Port. </li>
                                <li>Relationship to the process?→The process owns the socket, which is stored in the PCB. It can be shared during a fork.</li>

                        <li>What is the &quot;window size&quot; in the context of sockets?→The &quot;window size&quot; refers to the amount of data that can be sent before needing an acknowledgment from the receiver. The concept of window sizing is part of flow control. This helps prevent overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once. </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Building requests(jobs), each getting its own thread</li>

                                        <li>The linker is a critical tool in the compilation process that combines multiple object files (generated by the compiler) into a single executable or library. </li>
                                        <li>It resolves references between these files (like function calls) and links them with system libraries (e.g., the C++ standard library) to produce a working program. </li>
                                        <li>Essentially, it &quot;stitches together&quot; all the compiled code so it can run properly.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Why does the code run everywhere?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Interpreted languages run on a virtual machine, the interpreter, allowing code to run on any system with a compatible virtual machine. </li>
                                        <li>The interpreter acts as a universal middle layer, translating Python byte code into machine-specific instructions at runtime, making it platform-independent as long as the interpreter is available for that system. </li>
                                        <li>For example, in python there is the python runtime containing the interpreter, core libraries and so on and is called for execution:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Windows: <q>python.exe hello.py</q></li>
                                                <li>Linux: <q>./python hello.py</q> </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Each line is interpreted ⇒ obviously slower</li>
                                <li>Examples are python, Java and JavaScript</li>
                                <li>Just in Time Compilation
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Explain how it works
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Hybrid Approach: Combines interpretation + compilation for speed and portability.</li>
                                                <li>Step 1: Interpret First: Code runs via an interpreter (platform-independent).</li>
                                                <li>Step 2: Profile Hot Code: Identifies frequently executed parts (e.g., loops).</li>
                                                <li>Step 3: Compile Dynamically: Converts hot code to optimized machine code for the host CPU and puts it on the heap.</li>
                                                <li>Step 4: Point the CPU program counter to the memory which is marked as executable</li>
                                                <li>Result: Faster than pure interpretation, more flexible than static compilation (e.g., Java’s JVM, PyPy, JavaScript’s V8).</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>

                                </li>

                                <li>Some languages manage memory for the user: Go, Python, Java</li>
                                <li>How does it work?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Part of the runtime</li>
                                        <li>Tracks Object Usage: The garbage collector (GC) monitors which objects are still being referenced by active parts of the program.</li>
                                        <li>Identifies Garbage: It periodically scans memory to find unreachable objects (no longer referenced by anything).</li>
                                        <li>Reclaims Memory: Automatically frees the memory occupied by unused objects, preventing leaks.</li>
                                        <li>Slows down the program since CPU time and memory is needed for that task and also the GC needs to ensure that no new reference is created during the cleanup, for example by using a mutex</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>In the process memory space, there is an additional part at the top of each process. What is it?→It&#39;s the kernel stack space.</li>
                                <li>The CPU has two modes.→User and Kernel mode</li>
                                <li>What is done in CPU user mode?→The code of the user is executed</li>
                                <li>What is done in Kernel Mode?→The code from the kernel (in the kernel stack) is executed like system calls, drivers etc. </li>
                                <li>How are the access rights for kernel and user mode in the process memory space for kernel and user space?→In kernel mode, both spaces can be accessed, while in user mode only the user space can be accessed.</li>
                                <li>Describe what happens when the process switch to kernel mode→Almost the same as in a context switch between threads of the same process and when a function is called. The base pointer is stored on the kernel stack, as well as the return address. All registers values and states are stored in memory. </li>
                                <li>What cost comes with a kernel switch?
