- Describeâ†’A redirector is a special symbol that can be used to redirect the input or output from one command to another.
- Explanation of using `echo` and using `>` to redirect the output to a file. Since this was also part of the [Missing Semester]() class I skip this one here.  
- `type <FILE>`::Command used in a command line interface to display the contents of a specified file `<FILE>`.
- `<CMD> >> <FILE>`::Append the output of `<CMD>` to an existing file `<FILE>` 
- 
- Combining commands
    - `&&`::Only runs the second command if the first runs succesfully. 
    - `&`::Always runs the second command.
    - `||`::Only runs the second command if the first one files.
    - `|`::Redirects the output of the first command as input to the second command.
