        <li>What is one key advantage of an SD-WAN appliance having multiple internet connections?→It allows the appliance to prioritize high-priority traffic, like point-of-sale data, by sending it over the best-performing available connection (e.g., cable modem or 5G) and to fail over if one connection fails.</li>
