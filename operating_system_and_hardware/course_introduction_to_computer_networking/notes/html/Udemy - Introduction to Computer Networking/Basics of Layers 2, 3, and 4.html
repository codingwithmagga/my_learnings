    <ul>
        <li>LAN
            <ul>
                <li>What is a Hub?→Hubs are basic network devices that flood incoming traffic to all connected ports. Inefficient for unicast communication, leading to collision domains where devices must take turns transmitting.</li>
                <li>What is a unicast communication?→Communication between a single sender and a single receiver</li>
                <li>Explain the term &quot;collision domain&quot;→A network segment where two or more devices can collide, resulting in a data transmission failure, typically in Ethernet networks using hubs.</li>
                <li>What is a Layer 2 Bridge→Bridges improve network efficiency by using MAC tables to forward traffic selectively. Collision domains are reduced, enhancing network performance. Bridges are a precursor to switches.</li>
                <li>What is a switch?
                    <ul>
                        <li>A network device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and forwards data packets between them based on MAC addresses.</li>
                        <li>They have MAC tables associating MAC addresses with specific ports, enabling targeted forwarding.</li>
                        <li>Each port on a switch is its own collision domain, reducing collision issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is a broadcast domain?
                    <ul>
                        <li>A network segment where all devices can receive each other&#39;s broadcast frames. </li>
                        <li>Broadcast traffic is flooded to every port within the broadcast domain. </li>
                        <li>A switch creates a single broadcast domain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is a router?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Device that forwards data packets</li>
                        <li>Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer)</li>
                        <li>Uses IP addresses for routing</li>
                        <li>Connects different networks</li>
                        <li>Routers can be used to break up L2-broadcast domains and reduce broadcast traffic.</li>

                <li>Name the remark sentence for the layers→All people seem to need data processing. </li>
                <li>Name the seven layers→Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application</li>
                <li>Practical example: uploading a video to YouTube
                    <ul>
                        <li>The application, presentation, and session layers (7-5) handle the interface and preparation of data for transport.</li>
                        <li>The transport layer (Layer 4) manages data segmentation and reliability through protocols like HTTP.</li>
                        <li>The network layer (Layer 3) is where IP addressing comes into play, guiding the data to its correct destination across the internet.</li>
                        <li>The data link layer (Layer 2) uses MAC addresses to deliver data to the correct device on the local network.</li>
                        <li>Finally, the physical layer (Layer 1) involves the actual hardware and transmission mediums that carry the data.</li>

                <li>Explain the structure of a MAC Table→A table that maps MAC addresses to ports on a network switch, used for forwarding data packets to the correct destination device.</li>
                <li>Entries in a MAC table are {{802702292215418::temporary}}.</li>
                <li>When connecting a hub or a switch to another switch, {{21194024913077836::multiple}} MAC addresses may be associated with a single port. </li>

        </li>
        <li>BUM traffic
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li>BUM Traffic refers to a collective term used to describe three distinct types of traffic on Ethernet networks: {{76170798163242::Broadcast}}, {{76170798163242::Unknown Unicast}}, and {{76170798163242::Multicast}}.</li>
                <li>MAC addresses are {{7259361427221174::hard-coded}} and associated with network interfaces, while IP addresses are {{21763925138142748::manually}} assigned and serve as network identifiers.</li>
                <li>What is an ARP Request?→A layer2 broadcast message sent to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.</li>
                <li>What is an ARP Table?→A table on a computer that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a network.</li>
                <li>What is an unknown unicast?→A frame sent to a MAC address that is not known to the switch, and therefore flooded out all ports.</li>
                <li>Switches can be {{8057383287083689::interconnected}} to create larger networks and operate as a unified switch.</li>
                <li>What is a multicast?→A transmission sent to multiple destinations simultaneously. The switch identifies the ports belonging to the multicast group and forwards the traffic only to those ports.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Routers
            <ul>
                <li>What is the role of routers in network architecture?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Routers are essential devices that serve as a boundary between different Layer 2 networks, enabling distinct network segments.</li>
                        <li>The presence of routers between segments reduces broadcast traffic and isolates network domains.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A router creates different network segments, for example, when connected to two or more switches.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each segment established by a router has its own unique {{7491481183213702::IP address range}} and {{7491481183213702::subnet}}.</li>
                        <li>Devices within each segment are assigned IP addresses specific to their respective {{2421514102143565::subnets}}. </li>
                        <li>Each segment, connected through a router, forms its own distinct {{9473762168682747:: broadcast domain}}.</li>
                        <li>Routers do not propagate {{8503145308864417::Layer 2}} broadcasts between segments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is a default gateway?→The IP address of the router that a device uses to access another network. Routers act as default gateways for devices within their respective segments.</li>
                <li>When devices need to communicate with other segments or networks, they send traffic to the router, which makes routing decisions based on {{901620260514326::Layer 3 IP addresses}}. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Explain PoE→Power over Ethernet (PoE), a technology that allows an Ethernet cable to carry both data and power, enabling devices to receive power over the same cable used for network connectivity.</li>
