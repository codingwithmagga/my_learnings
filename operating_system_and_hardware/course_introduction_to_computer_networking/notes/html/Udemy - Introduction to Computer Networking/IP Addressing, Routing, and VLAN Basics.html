        <li>IP Addresses and Subnets
            <ul>
                <li>What is the name of a part of an IP address?→Octet (8 bits for each number)</li>
                <li>Explain /24 networks→A /24 network has 24 bits as network portion leaving the rest (8 bits) for individual IP addresses. It refers to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which allows for 256 possible IP addresses.</li>
                <li>Special IPs in /24 networks (in general): {{5007044420831693::Network Address}} (x.x.x.0), {{5007044420831693::Default Gateway}} (x.x.x.1), and {{5007044420831693::Broadcast Address}} (x.x.x.255).</li>

        <li>Packet Walk
            <ul>
                <li>This lecture shows how a package is sent from one computer to another computer in a different network segment connected via a router. It goes like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each IP packet contains a source and destination IP address. These addresses determine the sender and recipient of the data.</li>
                        <li>The default gateway, typically residing on a router within the same local area network, serves as the bridge for outbound traffic destined for other networks.</li>
                        <li>When an IP packet is prepared for transmission, it includes Layer 2 addressing information. This information encompasses the source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                        <li>The source computer generates an Ethernet frame by appending the source and destination MAC addresses, corresponding to its network segment.</li>
                        <li>The Ethernet frame arrives at a physical switch. The switch analyzes the Layer 2 addressing, identifies the destination MAC, and forwards the frame within the local segment.</li>
                        <li>Upon reaching the router, the Ethernet frame is examined. The router deciphers the destination MAC, acknowledging its role in the transmission process.</li>
                        <li>The router proceeds to inspect the destination IP address within the IP packet. It determines if the packet should be routed to another network.</li>
                        <li>To forward the packet to the next network segment, the router checks its ARP table to link the destination IP with the appropriate MAC address.</li>
                        <li>The router appends new Layer 2 headers to the packet to accommodate its journey into the next network segment, including source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                        <li>The updated Ethernet frame is sent to the switch, which forwards it based on the new destination MAC address, ensuring it reaches the intended segment.</li>
                        <li>The Ethernet frame arrives at the destination computer. The computer recognizes its MAC address, proceeds to extract the Layer 3 addressing information, and retrieves the payload for processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>ICMP and Ping
            <ul>
                <li>What is ICMP?→ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for error reporting and diagnostic functions in IP networks. It works on the network layer.</li>
                <li>What does the <q>ping</q> command do?→Sends ICMP echo request packets to test network connectivity and measures response time.</li>
                <li>Explain TTL→Time to live, a field in IP packets that limits the number of hops (router passes) before the packet is discarded.</li>
                <li>What is the loopback address?→127.0.0.1, the local IP address on every computer.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>VLAN
            <ul>
                <li>What is a VLAN?→A virtual LAN is a logical subnet that divides a physical network into several separate virtual logical segments, which operate like independent physical networks. Each VLAN has a subnet and is a broadcast domain.</li>
                <li>Explain the term physical segmentation→Separating devices with switches and routers. In the router it is possible to specify which networks can speak with each other.</li>
                <li>What is a trunk port?→A port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs over only one physical device.</li>
                <li>What is an access port→A port that belongs to only one VLAN and carries traffic for that VLAN only.</li>
                <li></li>
