    <ul>
        <li>What is the role of routers in network architecture?
            <ul>
                <li>Routers are essential devices that serve as a boundary between different Layer 2 networks, enabling distinct network segments.</li>
                <li>The presence of routers between segments reduces broadcast traffic and isolates network domains.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A router creates different network segments, for example, when connected to two or more switches.
            <ul>
                <li>Each segment established by a router has its own unique {{7491481183213702::IP address range}} and {{7491481183213702::subnet}}.</li>
                <li>Devices within each segment are assigned IP addresses specific to their respective {{2421514102143565::subnets}}. </li>
                <li>Each segment, connected through a router, forms its own distinct {{9473762168682747:: broadcast domain}}.</li>
                <li>Routers do not propagate {{8503145308864417::Layer 2}} broadcasts between segments.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is a default gateway?â†’The IP address of the router that a device uses to access another network. Routers act as default gateways for devices within their respective segments.</li>
        <li>When devices need to communicate with other segments or networks, they send traffic to the router, which makes routing decisions based on {{901620260514326::Layer 3 IP addresses}}. </li>
