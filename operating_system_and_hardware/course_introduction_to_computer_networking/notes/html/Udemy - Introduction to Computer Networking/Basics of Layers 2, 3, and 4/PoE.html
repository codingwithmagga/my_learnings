        <li>What is the difference between PoE, PoE+, and PoE++?→PoE (Power over Ethernet) provides up to 15.4 W of power, PoE+ provides up to 30 W, and PoE++ provides up to 60 W (also known as PoE Type 3) or 100 W (PoE Type 4).</li>
        <li>How does PoE improve flexibility in device placement?→By eliminating the need for a nearby power outlet.</li>
