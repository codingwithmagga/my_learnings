    <ul>
        <li>What is a Hub?→Hubs are basic network devices that flood incoming traffic to all connected ports. Inefficient for unicast communication, leading to collision domains where devices must take turns transmitting.</li>
        <li>What is a unicast communication?→Communication between a single sender and a single receiver</li>
        <li>Explain the term &quot;collision domain&quot;→A network segment where two or more devices can collide, resulting in a data transmission failure, typically in Ethernet networks using hubs.</li>
        <li>What is a Layer 2 Bridge→Bridges improve network efficiency by using MAC tables to forward traffic selectively. Collision domains are reduced, enhancing network performance. Bridges are a precursor to switches.</li>
        <li>What is a switch?
            <ul>
                <li>A network device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and forwards data packets between them based on MAC addresses.</li>
                <li>They have MAC tables associating MAC addresses with specific ports, enabling targeted forwarding.</li>
                <li>Each port on a switch is its own collision domain, reducing collision issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is a broadcast domain?
            <ul>
                <li>A network segment where all devices can receive each other&#39;s broadcast frames. </li>
                <li>Broadcast traffic is flooded to every port within the broadcast domain. </li>
                <li>A switch creates a single broadcast domain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is a router?
            <ul>
                <li>Device that forwards data packets</li>
                <li>Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer)</li>
                <li>Uses IP addresses for routing</li>
                <li>Connects different networks</li>
                <li>Routers can be used to break up L2-broadcast domains and reduce broadcast traffic.</li>
            </ul>
