      OSI Model
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain the OSI Model shortly→A 7-layered framework for designing and implementing computer networks.</li>
        <li>Name the remark sentence for the layers→All people seem to need data processing. </li>
        <li>Name the seven layers→Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application</li>
        <li>Practical example: uploading a video to YouTube
            <ul>
                <li>The application, presentation, and session layers (7-5) handle the interface and preparation of data for transport.</li>
                <li>The transport layer (Layer 4) manages data segmentation and reliability through protocols like HTTP.</li>
                <li>The network layer (Layer 3) is where IP addressing comes into play, guiding the data to its correct destination across the internet.</li>
                <li>The data link layer (Layer 2) uses MAC addresses to deliver data to the correct device on the local network.</li>
                <li>Finally, the physical layer (Layer 1) involves the actual hardware and transmission mediums that carry the data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>At each layer (4, 3, 2), a header is added: {{29618812706215514::port number}} (layer 4), {{29618812706215514::IP address}} (layer 3), and {{29618812706215514::MAC address}} (layer 2).</li>

    </ul>
