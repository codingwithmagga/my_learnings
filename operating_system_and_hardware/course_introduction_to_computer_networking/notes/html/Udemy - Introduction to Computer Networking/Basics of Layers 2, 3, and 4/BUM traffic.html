        <li>BUM Traffic refers to a collective term used to describe three distinct types of traffic on Ethernet networks: {{76170798163242::Broadcast}}, {{76170798163242::Unknown Unicast}}, and {{76170798163242::Multicast}}.</li>
        <li>MAC addresses are {{7259361427221174::hard-coded}} and associated with network interfaces, while IP addresses are {{21763925138142748::manually}} assigned and serve as network identifiers.</li>
        <li>What is an ARP Request?→A layer2 broadcast message sent to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.</li>
        <li>What is an ARP Table?→A table on a computer that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a network.</li>
        <li>What is an unknown unicast?→A frame sent to a MAC address that is not known to the switch, and therefore flooded out all ports.</li>
        <li>Switches can be {{8057383287083689::interconnected}} to create larger networks and operate as a unified switch.</li>
        <li>What is a multicast?→A transmission sent to multiple destinations simultaneously. The switch identifies the ports belonging to the multicast group and forwards the traffic only to those ports.</li>
