      Packet Walk

    <ul>
        <li>This lecture shows how a package is sent from one computer to another computer in a different network segment connected via a router. It goes like this:
            <ul>
                <li>Each IP packet contains a source and destination IP address. These addresses determine the sender and recipient of the data.</li>
                <li>The default gateway, typically residing on a router within the same local area network, serves as the bridge for outbound traffic destined for other networks.</li>
                <li>When an IP packet is prepared for transmission, it includes Layer 2 addressing information. This information encompasses the source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                <li>The source computer generates an Ethernet frame by appending the source and destination MAC addresses, corresponding to its network segment.</li>
                <li>The Ethernet frame arrives at a physical switch. The switch analyzes the Layer 2 addressing, identifies the destination MAC, and forwards the frame within the local segment.</li>
                <li>Upon reaching the router, the Ethernet frame is examined. The router deciphers the destination MAC, acknowledging its role in the transmission process.</li>
                <li>The router proceeds to inspect the destination IP address within the IP packet. It determines if the packet should be routed to another network.</li>
                <li>To forward the packet to the next network segment, the router checks its ARP table to link the destination IP with the appropriate MAC address.</li>
                <li>The router appends new Layer 2 headers to the packet to accommodate its journey into the next network segment, including source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                <li>The updated Ethernet frame is sent to the switch, which forwards it based on the new destination MAC address, ensuring it reaches the intended segment.</li>
                <li>The Ethernet frame arrives at the destination computer. The computer recognizes its MAC address, proceeds to extract the Layer 3 addressing information, and retrieves the payload for processing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
