        <li>What is a VLAN?→A virtual LAN is a logical subnet that divides a physical network into several separate virtual logical segments, which operate like independent physical networks. Each VLAN has a subnet and is a broadcast domain.</li>
        <li>Explain the term physical segmentation→Separating devices with switches and routers. In the router it is possible to specify which networks can speak with each other.</li>
        <li>What is a trunk port?→A port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs over only one physical device.</li>
