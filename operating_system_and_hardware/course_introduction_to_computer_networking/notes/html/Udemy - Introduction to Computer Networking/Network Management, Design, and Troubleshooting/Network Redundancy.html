      Network Redundancy

    <ul>
        <li>What is a single point of failure?→A component or part of a system that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail.</li>
        <li>What is the core purpose of implementing network redundancy?→The core purpose is to eliminate single points of failure to keep the network functioning properly even when a component fails, ensuring high availability.</li>
        <li>What is the role of a dynamic routing protocol in a failure scenario?→A dynamic routing protocol acts like a GPS for the network, automatically detecting a failed connection and dynamically calculating a new path for traffic to take.</li>
        <li>What problem do protocols like HSRP and VRRP solve?→They solve the problem of a server&#39;s default gateway failing by allowing multiple routers to share a virtual IP address, which a backup router can take over if the primary fails.</li>
