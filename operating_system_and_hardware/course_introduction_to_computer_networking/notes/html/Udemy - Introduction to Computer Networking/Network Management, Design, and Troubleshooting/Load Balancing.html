      Load Balancing
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Why should we add load balancing?→To distribute workload across multiple identical servers (possible in different locations), improving responsiveness/availability, reliability, and scalability.</li>
        <li>How can health checks be achieved with load balancing→By periodically sending requests to registered servers and verifying responses are received within a specified time interval.</li>
