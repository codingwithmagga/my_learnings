                                <li>Routers are essential devices that serve as a boundary between different Layer 2 networks, enabling distinct network segments.</li>
                                <li>The presence of routers between segments reduces broadcast traffic and isolates network domains.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A router creates different network segments, for example, when connected to two or more switches.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Each segment established by a router has its own unique {{7491481183213702::IP address range}} and {{7491481183213702::subnet}}.</li>
                                <li>Devices within each segment are assigned IP addresses specific to their respective {{2421514102143565::subnets}}. </li>
                                <li>Each segment, connected through a router, forms its own distinct {{9473762168682747:: broadcast domain}}.</li>
                                <li>Routers do not propagate {{8503145308864417::Layer 2}} broadcasts between segments.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>What is a default gateway?→The IP address of the router that a device uses to access another network. Routers act as default gateways for devices within their respective segments.</li>
                        <li>When devices need to communicate with other segments or networks, they send traffic to the router, which makes routing decisions based on {{901620260514326::Layer 3 IP addresses}}. </li>

                                <li>When an IP packet is prepared for transmission, it includes Layer 2 addressing information. This information encompasses the source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                                <li>The source computer generates an Ethernet frame by appending the source and destination MAC addresses, corresponding to its network segment.</li>
                                <li>The Ethernet frame arrives at a physical switch. The switch analyzes the Layer 2 addressing, identifies the destination MAC, and forwards the frame within the local segment.</li>
                                <li>Upon reaching the router, the Ethernet frame is examined. The router deciphers the destination MAC, acknowledging its role in the transmission process.</li>
                                <li>The router proceeds to inspect the destination IP address within the IP packet. It determines if the packet should be routed to another network.</li>
                                <li>To forward the packet to the next network segment, the router checks its ARP table to link the destination IP with the appropriate MAC address.</li>
                                <li>The router appends new Layer 2 headers to the packet to accommodate its journey into the next network segment, including source and destination MAC addresses.</li>
                                <li>The updated Ethernet frame is sent to the switch, which forwards it based on the new destination MAC address, ensuring it reaches the intended segment.</li>
                                <li>The Ethernet frame arrives at the destination computer. The computer recognizes its MAC address, proceeds to extract the Layer 3 addressing information, and retrieves the payload for processing.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What does a VPN do?→A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a server on the internet. This hides your online activity from your internet provider and anyone else on your network, and it masks your real IP address to make it look like you are browsing from the VPN server&#39;s location. This enhances your privacy and security, especially on public Wi-Fi.</li>

                        <li>What is the IPv4 address range?→$0.0.0.0$ to $255.255.255.255$</li>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the Class A address range?→To provide addresses for large networks with many hosts, with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 (/8). These ranges are always given as a whole to too big networks/organizations. Range from 1.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0</li>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the Class B address range?→To provide a range of IP addresses for medium-sized networks, specifically for organizations up to 65,536 hosts. Ranges from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0.</li>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the Class C address range?→To provide a range of IP addresses for small to medium-sized networks, with 256 possible addresses per network. Ranges from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0.</li>
                        <li>Describe the issue with classful IP addressing→Wasted IP addresses due to fixed class boundaries.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Why is 255 special?→It is the highest number that can be stored in an 8-bit binary number. And so it is the highest value in an octet in an IP address.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Define Subnetting→Dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable segments to improve efficiency, security, and IP address allocation.</li>
                        <li>Reason for subnetting in big organizations?→Subnetting in large organizations is primarily done for security. By splitting the network into smaller segments, communication between them must pass through a router, which can enforce firewall rules and other security measures. This setup helps control access and protects sensitive parts of the network.</li>
                        <li>An organization has a class B network starting at 145.14.0.0/16. </li>
                        <li>How to reduce the number of given IP addresses using the subnet mask?→By borrowing bits from the host portion to create a larger network portion, thereby creating more subnets with fewer host addresses per subnet. For example, 145.14.0.0/22 gives the range 145.14.0.0-145.14.3.255.</li>

                <li>Subnets and CIDR Notation
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the subnet mask?→To determine the scope of the local network for a given IP address.</li>
                        <li>Explain the CIDR notation→A way to express the number of bits in a subnet mask, written as a slash followed by the number of bits, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24. For example, IP address 97.122.14.233/25 is the network address 97.122.14.128/25 and the broadcast address 97.122.14.255/25.</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Practice Videos: Subnets
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three videos about CIDR notation and subnets examples.</li>
                        <li>Examples of how to calculate the number of hosts.</li>
                        <li>Take the range and subtract network and broadcast addresses.</li>
                        <li>So a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 gives us 256-2=254 host addresses.</li>
                    </ul>
