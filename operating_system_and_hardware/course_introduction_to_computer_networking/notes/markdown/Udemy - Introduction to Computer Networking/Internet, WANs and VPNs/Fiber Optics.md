- Difference between coaxial cable and fiber optics→Coaxial cable uses electrical signals over copper; fiber optics uses light signals over glass or plastic fibers (about the width of a human hair).
- Benefits of fiber optic?→High speed, High bandwidth, low attenuation, and immunity to electromagnetic interference.
- Name two types of fiber optics >>>
    - Single-mode fiber (SMF) optics, single light path, best for long distances.
    - Multi-mode fiber (MMF) optics, multiple light paths, for shorter local distances.
