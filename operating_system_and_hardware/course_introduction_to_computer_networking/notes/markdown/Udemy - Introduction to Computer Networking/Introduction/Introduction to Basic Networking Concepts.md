- {{Local Area Networks}} (LANs) connect devices within a single physical location for seamless communication.
- Ethernet switches play a pivotal role in connecting devices in a LAN and are typically used in a {{star}} topology.
- Explain star topologyâ†’A star topology connects all nodes to a central hub or switch.
- The OSI model helps organize networking tasks into layers, with Layer One dealing with {{physical }}aspects.
- Ethernet, whether wired or {{wireless}}, remains a fundamental technology in LANs.
- Network Interface Cards (NICs) have unique {{MAC}} addresses, facilitating communication within the LAN.
- Ethernet frames consist of a {{Payload}}, {{Destination MAC}}, and {{Source MAC}}, akin to an envelope for efficient data exchange.
