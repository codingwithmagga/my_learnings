- LAN
    - What is a Hub?→Hubs are basic network devices that flood incoming traffic to all connected ports. Inefficient for unicast communication, leading to collision domains where devices must take turns transmitting.
    - What is a unicast communication?→Communication between a single sender and a single receiver
    - Explain the term "collision domain"→A network segment where two or more devices can collide, resulting in a data transmission failure, typically in Ethernet networks using hubs.
    - What is a Layer 2 Bridge→Bridges improve network efficiency by using MAC tables to forward traffic selectively. Collision domains are reduced, enhancing network performance. Bridges are a precursor to switches.
    - What is a switch? >>>
        - A network device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and forwards data packets between them based on MAC addresses.
        - They have MAC tables associating MAC addresses with specific ports, enabling targeted forwarding.
        - Each port on a switch is its own collision domain, reducing collision issues.
    - What is a broadcast domain? >>>
        - A network segment where all devices can receive each other's broadcast frames. 
        - Broadcast traffic is flooded to every port within the broadcast domain. 
        - A switch creates a single broadcast domain.
    - What is a router? >>>
        - Device that forwards data packets
        - Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer)
        - Uses IP addresses for routing
        - Connects different networks
        - Routers can be used to break up L2-broadcast domains and reduce broadcast traffic.
    - 
    - Review:
        - Unicast is {{one-to-one}} communication.
        - Hubs flood incoming traffic to {{all}} ports, causing {{inefficiency}} and {{collision domains}}.
        - Bridges reduce collision domains by selectively forwarding traffic based on {{MAC tables}}.
        - Switches further improve efficiency with individual {{collision domains}} for each port.
        - Broadcast domains in switches can be {{large}}, impacting {{network efficiency}} and {{MAC table size}}.
        - Routers can be used to break up {{L2-broadcast domains}} and reduce broadcast {{traffic}}.
- OSI Model
    - Explain the OSI Model shortly→A 7-layered framework for designing and implementing computer networks.
    - Name the remark sentence for the layers→All people seem to need data processing. 
    - Name the seven layers→Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
    - Practical example: uploading a video to YouTube >>>
        - The application, presentation, and session layers (7-5) handle the interface and preparation of data for transport.
        - The transport layer (Layer 4) manages data segmentation and reliability through protocols like HTTP.
        - The network layer (Layer 3) is where IP addressing comes into play, guiding the data to its correct destination across the internet.
        - The data link layer (Layer 2) uses MAC addresses to deliver data to the correct device on the local network.
        - Finally, the physical layer (Layer 1) involves the actual hardware and transmission mediums that carry the data.
    - At each layer (4, 3, 2), a header is added: {{port number}} (layer 4), {{IP address}} (layer 3), and {{MAC address}} (layer 2).
- Computer-Switch-Connection
    - Explain the structure of a MAC Table→A table that maps MAC addresses to ports on a network switch, used for forwarding data packets to the correct destination device.
    - Entries in a MAC table are {{temporary}}.
    - When connecting a hub or a switch to another switch, {{multiple}} MAC addresses may be associated with a single port. 
- BUM traffic
    - 
    - BUM Traffic refers to a collective term used to describe three distinct types of traffic on Ethernet networks: {{Broadcast}}, {{Unknown Unicast}}, and {{Multicast}}.
    - MAC addresses are {{hard-coded}} and associated with network interfaces, while IP addresses are {{manually}} assigned and serve as network identifiers.
    - What is an ARP Request?→A layer2 broadcast message sent to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.
    - What is an ARP Table?→A table on a computer that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a network.
    - What is an unknown unicast?→A frame sent to a MAC address that is not known to the switch, and therefore flooded out all ports.
    - Switches can be {{interconnected}} to create larger networks and operate as a unified switch.
    - What is a multicast?→A transmission sent to multiple destinations simultaneously. The switch identifies the ports belonging to the multicast group and forwards the traffic only to those ports.
- Routers
    - What is the role of routers in network architecture? >>>
        - Routers are essential devices that serve as a boundary between different Layer 2 networks, enabling distinct network segments.
        - The presence of routers between segments reduces broadcast traffic and isolates network domains.
    - A router creates different network segments, for example, when connected to two or more switches.
        - Each segment established by a router has its own unique {{IP address range}} and {{subnet}}.
        - Devices within each segment are assigned IP addresses specific to their respective {{subnets}}. 
        - Each segment, connected through a router, forms its own distinct {{ broadcast domain}}.
        - Routers do not propagate {{Layer 2}} broadcasts between segments.
    - What is a default gateway?→The IP address of the router that a device uses to access another network. Routers act as default gateways for devices within their respective segments.
    - When devices need to communicate with other segments or networks, they send traffic to the router, which makes routing decisions based on {{Layer 3 IP addresses}}.

    - How does PoE improve flexibility in device placement?→By eliminating the need for a nearby power outlet.
