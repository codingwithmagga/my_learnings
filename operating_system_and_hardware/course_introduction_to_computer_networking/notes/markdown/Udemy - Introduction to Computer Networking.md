        - {{Local Area Networks}} (LANs) connect devices within a single physical location for seamless communication.
        - Ethernet switches play a pivotal role in connecting devices in a LAN and are typically used in a {{star}} topology.
        - Explain star topology→A star topology connects all nodes to a central hub or switch.
        - The OSI model helps organize networking tasks into layers, with Layer One dealing with {{physical }}aspects.
        - Ethernet, whether wired or {{wireless}}, remains a fundamental technology in LANs.
        - Network Interface Cards (NICs) have unique {{MAC}} addresses, facilitating communication within the LAN.

- Basics of Layers 2, 3, and 4
    - LAN
        - What is a Hub?→Hubs are basic network devices that flood incoming traffic to all connected ports. Inefficient for unicast communication, leading to collision domains where devices must take turns transmitting.
        - What is a unicast communication?→Communication between a single sender and a single receiver
        - Explain the term "collision domain"→A network segment where two or more devices can collide, resulting in a data transmission failure, typically in Ethernet networks using hubs.
        - What is a Layer 2 Bridge→Bridges improve network efficiency by using MAC tables to forward traffic selectively. Collision domains are reduced, enhancing network performance. Bridges are a precursor to switches.
        - What is a switch? >>>
            - A network device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and forwards data packets between them based on MAC addresses.
            - They have MAC tables associating MAC addresses with specific ports, enabling targeted forwarding.
            - Each port on a switch is its own collision domain, reducing collision issues.
        - What is a broadcast domain? >>>
            - A network segment where all devices can receive each other's broadcast frames. 
            - Broadcast traffic is flooded to every port within the broadcast domain. 
            - A switch creates a single broadcast domain.
        - What is a router? >>>
            - Device that forwards data packets

        - Review:
            - Unicast is {{one-to-one}} communication.
            - Hubs flood incoming traffic to {{all}} ports, causing {{inefficiency}} and {{collision domains}}.
            - Bridges reduce collision domains by selectively forwarding traffic based on {{MAC tables}}.
            - Switches further improve efficiency with individual {{collision domains}} for each port.
            - Broadcast domains in switches can be {{large}}, impacting {{network efficiency}} and {{MAC table size}}.
            - Routers can be used to break up {{L2-broadcast domains}} and reduce broadcast {{traffic}}.
    - OSI Model
        - Explain the OSI Model shortly→A 7-layered framework for designing and implementing computer networks.
        - Name the remark sentence for the layers→All people seem to need data processing. 
        - Name the seven layers→Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
        - Practical example: uploading a video to YouTube >>>
            - The application, presentation, and session layers (7-5) handle the interface and preparation of data for transport.
            - The transport layer (Layer 4) manages data segmentation and reliability through protocols like HTTP.
            - The network layer (Layer 3) is where IP addressing comes into play, guiding the data to its correct destination across the internet.
            - The data link layer (Layer 2) uses MAC addresses to deliver data to the correct device on the local network.
            - Finally, the physical layer (Layer 1) involves the actual hardware and transmission mediums that carry the data.
        - At each layer (4, 3, 2), a header is added: {{port number}} (layer 4), {{IP address}} (layer 3), and {{MAC address}} (layer 2).
    - Computer-Switch-Connection
        - Explain the structure of a MAC Table→A table that maps MAC addresses to ports on a network switch, used for forwarding data packets to the correct destination device.
        - Entries in a MAC table are {{temporary}}.
        - When connecting a hub or a switch to another switch, {{multiple}} MAC addresses may be associated with a single port. 
    - BUM traffic
        - 
        - BUM Traffic refers to a collective term used to describe three distinct types of traffic on Ethernet networks: {{Broadcast}}, {{Unknown Unicast}}, and {{Multicast}}.

        - What is an ARP Request?→A layer2 broadcast message sent to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.
        - What is an ARP Table?→A table on a computer that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a network.
        - What is an unknown unicast?→A frame sent to a MAC address that is not known to the switch, and therefore flooded out all ports.
        - Switches can be {{interconnected}} to create larger networks and operate as a unified switch.
        - What is a multicast?→A transmission sent to multiple destinations simultaneously. The switch identifies the ports belonging to the multicast group and forwards the traffic only to those ports.
    - Routers
        - What is the role of routers in network architecture? >>>
            - Routers are essential devices that serve as a boundary between different Layer 2 networks, enabling distinct network segments.
            - The presence of routers between segments reduces broadcast traffic and isolates network domains.
        - A router creates different network segments, for example, when connected to two or more switches.
            - Each segment established by a router has its own unique {{IP address range}} and {{subnet}}.
            - Devices within each segment are assigned IP addresses specific to their respective {{subnets}}. 
            - Each segment, connected through a router, forms its own distinct {{ broadcast domain}}.
            - Routers do not propagate {{Layer 2}} broadcasts between segments.
        - What is a default gateway?→The IP address of the router that a device uses to access another network. Routers act as default gateways for devices within their respective segments.
        - When devices need to communicate with other segments or networks, they send traffic to the router, which makes routing decisions based on {{Layer 3 IP addresses}}.

    - Packet Walk
        - This lecture shows how a package is sent from one computer to another computer in a different network segment connected via a router. It goes like this: >>>
            - Each IP packet contains a source and destination IP address. These addresses determine the sender and recipient of the data.
            - The default gateway, typically residing on a router within the same local area network, serves as the bridge for outbound traffic destined for other networks.
            - When an IP packet is prepared for transmission, it includes Layer 2 addressing information. This information encompasses the source and destination MAC addresses.
            - The source computer generates an Ethernet frame by appending the source and destination MAC addresses, corresponding to its network segment.
            - The Ethernet frame arrives at a physical switch. The switch analyzes the Layer 2 addressing, identifies the destination MAC, and forwards the frame within the local segment.
            - Upon reaching the router, the Ethernet frame is examined. The router deciphers the destination MAC, acknowledging its role in the transmission process.
            - The router proceeds to inspect the destination IP address within the IP packet. It determines if the packet should be routed to another network.
            - To forward the packet to the next network segment, the router checks its ARP table to link the destination IP with the appropriate MAC address.
            - The router appends new Layer 2 headers to the packet to accommodate its journey into the next network segment, including source and destination MAC addresses.
            - The updated Ethernet frame is sent to the switch, which forwards it based on the new destination MAC address, ensuring it reaches the intended segment.
            - The Ethernet frame arrives at the destination computer. The computer recognizes its MAC address, proceeds to extract the Layer 3 addressing information, and retrieves the payload for processing.
    - ICMP and Ping

        - The first 6 minutes are almost the same as the [NAT, Public, and Private IP Addresses](Udemy%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Networking/Network%20Security/NAT%2C%20Public%2C%20and%20Private%20IP%20Addresses.md)
        - Characteristics of public IP addresses >>>
            - Globally unique and routable on the internet
            - Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
            - Used to identify devices on the public internet.
            - Typically used for routers and firewalls facing the internet
        - Characteristics of private IP addresses >>>
            - Not globally unique and so not routable on the internet
            - Used for local networks, assigned by network administrators
            - Defined by RFC 1918
            - Ranges: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
            - Ranges: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
            - Ranges: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
    - IPv4 address structure
        - No new information. Every piece of information is already in [IP Addresses and Subnets](Udemy%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Networking/IP%20Addressing%2C%20Routing%2C%20and%20VLAN%20Basics/IP%20Addresses%20and%20Subnets.md).

    - Classful vs. Classless Addressing
        - What is the IPv4 address range?→$0.0.0.0$ to $255.255.255.255$
        - What is the purpose of the Class A address range?→To provide addresses for large networks with many hosts, with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 (/8). These ranges are always given as a whole to too big networks/organizations. Range from 1.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0
        - What is the purpose of the Class B address range?→To provide a range of IP addresses for medium-sized networks, specifically for organizations up to 65,536 hosts. Ranges from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0.
        - What is the purpose of the Class C address range?→To provide a range of IP addresses for small to medium-sized networks, with 256 possible addresses per network. Ranges from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0.
        - Describe the issue with classful IP addressing→Wasted IP addresses due to fixed class boundaries.
    - Converting Binary and Decimal
        - How to convert a decimal to a binary?→Divide the decimal number by 2, record the remainder, and repeat with the quotient until it is 0, then write the remainders in reverse order.
        - How to convert a binary to a decimal?→Sum the powers of 2 of each digit that is 1.
        - 
    - Why is 255 special?
        - Why is 255 special?→It is the highest number that can be stored in an 8-bit binary number. And so it is the highest value in an octet in an IP address.

    - Hands-on practice 
        - A practice lesson, no notes here.
    - Subnetting
        - Define Subnetting→Dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable segments to improve efficiency, security, and IP address allocation.
        - Reason for subnetting in big organizations?→Subnetting in large organizations is primarily done for security. By splitting the network into smaller segments, communication between them must pass through a router, which can enforce firewall rules and other security measures. This setup helps control access and protects sensitive parts of the network.
        - An organization has a class B network starting at 145.14.0.0/16. 
        - How to reduce the number of given IP addresses using the subnet mask?→By borrowing bits from the host portion to create a larger network portion, thereby creating more subnets with fewer host addresses per subnet. For example, 145.14.0.0/22 gives the range 145.14.0.0-145.14.3.255.
    - Subnets and CIDR Notation
        - What is the purpose of the subnet mask?→To determine the scope of the local network for a given IP address.
        - Explain the CIDR notation→A way to express the number of bits in a subnet mask, written as a slash followed by the number of bits, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24. For example, IP address 97.122.14.233/25 is the network address 97.122.14.128/25 and the broadcast address 97.122.14.255/25.

    - Practice Videos: Subnets
        - Three videos about CIDR notation and subnets examples.
        - Examples of how to calculate the number of hosts.
        - Take the range and subtract network and broadcast addresses.
        - So a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 gives us 256-2=254 host addresses.
    - Network address, broadcast address
        - All this content was already shown way earlier. I don't know why it comes in a 2-minute video at the end again.
